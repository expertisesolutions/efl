EFL is a collection of libraries for handling many common tasks a
developer man have such as data structures, communication, rendering,
widgets and more.

VALGRIND DEPENDENCY:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EFL uses the concept of memory pools (mempool) and this will confuse
valgrind memcheck tool. By using memory pool, the memory is still
owned by EFL, then valgrind won't alert on memory leaks or use of
unused memory. EFL will use memcheck.h from valgrind to declare its
memory pools to valgrind, producing better debugging results.

However valgrind is only available to limited platforms, making us
hard to declare it a mandatory requirement. Based on
--with-profile={dev,debug} valgrind will be used if available or will
be issued a warning. You can force valgrind with --enable-valgrind, or
disable it and the warning with --disable-valgrind.

EFL does NOT link to valgrind libraries. Then there is NO runtime
dependency on valgrind.


BULLET PHYSICS DEPENDENCY:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EFL comes with EPhysics(a physics wrapper library) enabled by default, to
build it the user must have BulletPhysics engine installed.

More informations about BulletPhysics can be obtained in the upstream project
web site at: http://bulletphysics.org.

We have received many reports about BulletPhysics installation and distros
packages in bad shape, some without even a package. If your distro doesn't
ship a BulletPhysics package or you want to build it from source code follow the
instructions below:

* Required Packages:
You should have cmake installed. Bullet comes with autotools and cmake build
systems, do not use the autotools alternative, it's unstable, bogus and hasn't
been maintained for quite some time.

* Download the tarball from:
http://code.google.com/p/bullet/downloads/list

NOTE: the current supported version is 2.80 or greater.

* Compiling and Installing:
Uncompress it to(say) ~/bullet and:

$ cd ~/bullet/build
$ cmake .. -DBUILD_CPU_DEMOS=OFF -DBUILD_DEMOS=OFF -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig

* Ubuntu Users:
Alternatively ubuntu users have the option to install the BulletPhysics from
our official EFL PPA:

https://launchpad.net/~efl/+archive/trunk

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPILING AND INSTALLING:

  ./configure
  make
(do this as root unless you are installing in your users directories):
  make install

EFL build is based on "profiles". It will default to "dev" for
unreleased software and "release" for official tarballs. One can
change it with --with-profile=NAME, where NAME is one of:

  * dev: extra checks useful to test software.

  * debug: superset of dev, with debug features and assert().

  * release: optimizations and less checks so it runs faster.


CRYPTOGRAPHIC SYSTEM: EFL officially uses "openssl" library to do
signature, cipher and related. Alternatively one can use "gnutls"
(some distros are strict about licenses and want gnutls instead of
openssl) or disable it. One can change it with --with-crypto=NAME,
where NAME is one of: "openssl", "gnutls" and "none".
