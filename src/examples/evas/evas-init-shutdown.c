/**
 * Example of initializing and shutting down Evas.
 *
 * For this introduction to Evas, we'll simply turn it on and off and
 * explain everything we're doing from the absolute basics, to provide
 * a starting point for understanding the other examples in this set,
 * which won't be explaining things quite so verbosely.
 *
 * See the @ref Example_Evas_Buffer_Simple as the next step in the tutorial.
 *
 * Evas examples can be built using the regular `make examples`, but each
 * example includes the compiler line for building that specific example if
 * you wish to build it in isolation:
 *
 * @verbatim
 * gcc -o evas-init-shutdown evas-init-shutdown.c `pkg-config --libs --cflags evas`
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * For this compilation to function properly, you'll need to have built and
 * installed the evas library and include files in a location that the pkg-config
 * tool will be able to find.  The example executable will be 'evas-init-shutdown'.
