/**
 * Example of using the buffer engine in Evas.
 *
 * In the evas-init-shutdown.c example we looked at how to turn Evas on
 * and off.  In this example we'll turn it on and off but also do
 * something in between.  We'll set up a canvas and add a few rectangles
 * to show how graphics objects are configured.
 *
 * In Evas, graphic rendering is done by a 'backend engine', which can
 * be changed to match the capabilities of the underlying hardware.  For
 * this example to keep things simple we will use the 'buffer engine'.
 * The buffer engine simply does all the rendering directly into a memory
 * buffer, with no hardware acceleration.
 *
 * In real world usage you probably would not be using the raw buffer
 * access that we'll be looking at here, but instead using higher level
 * functionality from Ecore and Ecore's Ecore-Evas submodule.  Ecore
 * provides convenience routines for creating and managing the canvas,
 * integrating with the main loop, and automating scene drawing.  Since
 * we're not yet ready to dig into Ecore's functionality, we'll
 * substitute our own dummy routines create_canvas(), destroy_canvas(),
 * and draw_scene(), so we can focus on the overall process flow in
 * main().
 *
 * For this example you must have Evas compiled with the buffer engine,
 * and have the evas-software-buffer pkg-config files installed.
 *
 * @verbatim
 * gcc -o evas-buffer-simple evas-buffer-simple.c `pkg-config --libs --cflags evas evas-software-buffer`
 * @endverbatim
