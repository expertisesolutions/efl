/**
 * @defgroup Ecore_Con_Group Ecore_Con - Connection functions
 * @ingroup Ecore
 *
 * The Ecore Connection Library ( @c Ecore_Con ) provides simple mechanisms
 * for communications between programs using reliable sockets.  It saves
 * the programmer from having to worry about file descriptors and waiting
 * for incoming connections.
 *
 * There are two main objects in the @c Ecore_Con library: the @c
 * Ecore_Con_Server and the @c Ecore_Con_Client.
 *
 * The @c Ecore_Con_Server represents a server that can be connected to.
 * It is used regardless of whether the program is acting as a server or
 * client itself.
 *
 * To create a listening server call @c ecore_con_server_add(), optionally using
 * an ECORE_CON_USE_* encryption type OR'ed with the type for encryption.
 *
 * To connect to a server, call @c ecore_con_server_connect(). Data can
 * then be sent to the server using the @c ecore_con_server_send().
 *
 * Functions are described in the following groupings:
 * @li @ref Ecore_Con_Lib_Group
 * @li @ref Ecore_Con_Server_Group
 * @li @ref Ecore_Con_Client_Group
 * @li @ref Ecore_Con_Url_Group
 *
 * Events are described in @ref Ecore_Con_Events_Group.
 */


/**
 * @defgroup Ecore_Con_Events_Group Ecore Connection Events Functions
 * @ingroup Ecore_Con_Group
 *
 * The Ecore Con events can be categorized into Server side events
 * and Client side events.
 * Server side events:
 * @li ECORE_CON_CLIENT_ADD: Whenever a client connection is made to an
 * @c Ecore_Con_Server, an event of this type is emitted, allowing the
 * retrieval of the client's ip with @ref ecore_con_client_ip_get and
 * associating data with the client using ecore_con_client_data_set.
 * @li ECORE_CON_EVENT_CLIENT_DEL: Whenever a client connection to an
 * @c Ecore_Con_Server is destroyed, an event of this type is emitted. The contents of
 * the data with this event are variable, but if the client object in the data
 * is non-null, it must be freed with @ref ecore_con_client_del.
 * @li ECORE_CON_EVENT_CLIENT_DATA: Whenever a server object receives
 * data, then an event of this type is emitted. The data will contain
 * the size and contents of the message sent by the client. It should be noted that
 * data within this object is transient, so it must be duplicated in order to be
 * retained. This event will continue to occur until the client has stopped sending its
 * message, so a good option for storing this data is an Eina_Strbuf. Once the message has
 * been received in full, the client object must be freed with ecore_con_client_free.
 *
 * Client side events:
 * @li ECORE_CON_EVENT_SERVER_ADD: Whenever a server object is created
 * with @ref ecore_con_server_connect, an event of this type is emitted,
 * allowing for data to be serialized and sent to the server using
 * @ref ecore_con_server_send. At this point, the http handshake has
 * occurred.
 * @li ECORE_CON_EVENT_SERVER_DEL: Whenever a server object is destroyed,
 * usually by the server connection being refused or dropped, an event of this
 * type is emitted. The contents of the data with this event are variable,
 * but if the server object in the data is non-null, it must be freed
 * with @ref ecore_con_server_del.
 * @li ECORE_CON_EVENT_SERVER_DATA: Whenever client object receives
 * data from the server, an event of this type is emitted. The data will contain both
 * the size and contents of the message sent by the server. It should be noted that
 * data within this object is transient, so it must be duplicated in order to be
 * retained. This event will continue to occur until the server has stopped sending its
 * message, so a good option for storing this data is an Eina_Strbuf. Once the message has
 * been received in full, the server object must be freed with ecore_con_server_free.

/**
 * @defgroup Ecore_Con_Buffer Ecore Connection Buffering
 * @ingroup Ecore_Con_Group
 * 
 * As Ecore_Con works on an event driven design, as data arrives, events will
 * be produced containing the data that arrived. It is up to the user of
 * Ecore_Con to either parse as they go, append to a file to later parse the
 * whole file in one go, or append to memory to parse or handle later.
 * 
 * To help with this Eina has some handy API's. The Eina_Binbuf and 
 * Eina_Strbuf APIs, abstract dynamic buffer management and make it trivial 
 * to handle buffers at runtime, without having to manage them. Eina_Binbuf 
 * makes it possible to create, expand, reset and slice a blob of memory - 
 * all via API. No system calls, no pointer manipulations and no size 
 * calculation.
 * 
 * Additional functions include adding content at specified byte positions in 
 * the buffer, escaping the inputs, find and replace strings. This provides 
 * extreme flexibility to play around, with a dynamic blob of memory.
 * 
 * It is good to free it (using eina_binbuf_free()) after using it.
 * 
 * Eina_Binbuf compliments Ecore_Con use cases, where dynamic sizes of data
 * arrive from the network (think http download in chunks). Using
 * Eina_Binbuf provides enough flexibility to handle data as it arrives and
 * to defer its processing until desired, without having to think about
 * where to store the temporary data and how to manage its size.
 * 
 * An example of how to use these with Ecore_Con follows.
 * 
 * @code
 * #include <Eina.h>
 * #include <Ecore.h>
 * #include <Ecore_Con.h>
 * 
 * static Eina_Bool
 * data_callback(void *data, int type, void *event)

 *      {
 *         // append data as it arrives - don't worry where or how it gets stored.
 *         // Also don't worry about size, expanding, reallocing etc.
 *         // just keep appending - size is automatically handled.
 * 
 *         eina_binbuf_append_length(data, url_data->data, url_data->size);
 * 
 *         fprintf(stderr, "Appended %d \n", url_data->size);

 * @param  name       Name used when determining what socket to connect to.
 *                    It is used to generate the socket name when the socket
 *                    is a Unix socket. It is used as the hostname when
 *                    connecting with a TCP socket.
 * @param  port       Number to identify the socket to connect to. Used when
 *                    generating the socket name for a Unix socket, or as the
 *                    TCP port when connecting to a TCP socket.
 * @param  data       Data to associate with the created Ecore_Con_Server
 *                    object.
 * @return A new Ecore_Con_Server.
 *
 * The socket to which the connection is made depends on the connection type:
 * @li If @a type is @c ECORE_CON_LOCAL_USER, the server will connect to
 *     the Unix socket. The path to the socket is taken from XDG_RUNTIME_DIR,
 *     if that is not set, then from HOME, even if this is not set, then from
 *     TMPDIR. If none is set, then path would be /tmp. From this path the
 *     function would connect to socket at "[path]/.ecore/[name]/[port]". If
 *     port is negative, then to socket at "[path]/.ecore/[name]".
 * @li If @a type is @c ECORE_CON_LOCAL_SYSTEM, the server will connect to
 *     Unix socket at "/tmp/.ecore_service|[name]|[port]". If port is negative,
 *     then to Unix socket at "/tmp/.ecore_service|[name]".
 * @li If @a type is @c ECORE_CON_LOCAL_ABSTRACT, then port number is not
 *     considered while connecting to socket.
 * @li If @a type is @c ECORE_CON_REMOTE_TCP, the server will listen
 *     on TCP port @c port.
 *
 * More information about the @p type can be found at @ref _Ecore_Con_Type.
 *
 * This function won't block. It will either succeed, or fail due to invalid
 * parameters, failed memory allocation, etc., returning @c NULL on that case.
 *
 * However, even if this call returns a valid @ref Ecore_Con_Server, the
 * connection will only be successfully completed if an event of type
 * @ref ECORE_CON_EVENT_SERVER_ADD is received. If it fails to complete, an
 * @ref ECORE_CON_EVENT_SERVER_DEL will be received.
 *
 * The created object gets deleted automatically if the connection to the
 * server is lost.
 *
 * The @p data parameter can be fetched later using ecore_con_server_data_get()
 * or changed with ecore_con_server_data_set().

 * 1. Create an Ecore_Con_Url object with ecore_con_url_new(url);
 * 2. Register to receive the #ECORE_CON_EVENT_URL_COMPLETE event

 * 3. Perform the operation with ecore_con_url_get(...);
