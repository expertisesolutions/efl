 *
 * This property overrides the global EFL configuration option
 * "accel_preference" for this single window, and accepts the same syntax.
 *
 * The @c accel string is a freeform C string that indicates what kind of
 * acceleration is preferred. Here "acceleration" generally refers to rendering
 * and the hardware with which the unit application renders GUIs. This may or
 * may not be honored but a best attempt will be made. Known strings are as
 * follows:
 *
 * "gl", "opengl" - try use OpenGL. "3d" - try to use a 3d acceleration unit.
 * "hw", "hardware", "accel" - try any acceleration unit (best possible) "none"
 * - use no acceleration but software instead (since 1.16)
 *
 * Since 1.14, it is also possible to specify some GL properties for the GL
 * window surface. This allows applications to use GLView with depth, stencil
 * and MSAA buffers with direct rendering. The new accel preference string
 * format is thus "{HW Accel}[:depth{value}[:stencil{value}[:msaa{str}$]$]$]".
 *
 * Accepted values for depth are for instance "depth", "depth16", "depth24".
 * Accepted values for stencil are "stencil", "stencil1", "stencil8". For MSAA,
 * only predefined strings are accepted: "msaa", "msaa_low", "msaa_mid" and
 * "msaa_high". The selected configuration is not guaranteed and is only valid
 * in case of GL acceleration. Only the base acceleration string will be saved
 * (e.g. "gl" or "hw").
 *
 * Full examples include:
 *
 * "gl", - try to use OpenGL "hw:depth:stencil", - use HW acceleration with
 * default depth and stencil buffers "opengl:depth24:stencil8:msaa_mid" - use
 * OpenGL with 24-bit depth, 8-bit stencil and a medium number of MSAA samples
 * in the backbuffer.
 *
 * Note that this option may be overriden by environment variables or the
 * configuration option "accel_preference_override".
 *
 * This will return the value of "accel_preference" when the window was
 * created.
