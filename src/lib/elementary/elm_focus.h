/**
 * @defgroup Elm_Focus Focus
 * @ingroup Elementary
 *
 * An Elementary application has, at all times, one (and only one)
 * @b focused object. This is what determines where the input
 * events go to within the application's window. Also, focused
 * objects can be decorated differently, in order to signal to the
 * user where the input is, at a given moment.
 *
 * Elementary applications also have the concept of <b>focus
 * chain</b>: one can cycle through all the windows' focusable
 * objects by input (tab key) or programmatically. The default
 * focus chain for an application is the one define by the order in
 * which the widgets where added in code. One will cycle through
 * top level widgets, and, for each one containing sub-objects, cycle
 * through them all, before returning to the level
 * above. Elementary also allows one to set @b custom focus chains
 * for their applications.
 *
 * Besides the focused decoration a widget may exhibit, when it
 * gets focus, Elementary has a @b global focus highlight object
 * that can be enabled for a window. If one chooses to do so, this
 * extra highlight effect will surround the current focused object,
 * too.
 *
 * @note Some Elementary widgets are @b unfocusable, after
 * creation, by their very nature: they are not meant to be
 * interacted with input events, but are there just for visual
 * purposes.
 *
 * @ref general_functions_example_page "This" example contemplates
 * some of these functions.
