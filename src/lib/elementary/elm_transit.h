/**
 * @defgroup Elm_Transit Transit
 * @ingroup Elementary
 *
 * Transit is designed to apply various animated transition effects to @c
 * Evas_Object, such like translation, rotation, etc. For using these
 * effects, create an @ref Elm_Transit and add the desired transition effects.
 *
 * Once the effects are added into transit, they will be automatically
 * managed (their callback will be called for the set duration and
 * they will be deleted upon completion).
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 * Elm_Transit *trans = elm_transit_add();
 * elm_transit_object_add(trans, obj);
 * elm_transit_effect_translation_add(trans, 0, 0, 280, 280
 * elm_transit_duration_set(transit, 1);
 * elm_transit_auto_reverse_set(transit, EINA_TRUE);
 * elm_transit_tween_mode_set(transit, ELM_TRANSIT_TWEEN_MODE_DECELERATE);
 * elm_transit_repeat_times_set(transit, 3);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Some transition effects are used to change the properties of objects. They
 * are:
 * @li @ref elm_transit_effect_translation_add
 * @li @ref elm_transit_effect_color_add
 * @li @ref elm_transit_effect_rotation_add
 * @li @ref elm_transit_effect_wipe_add
 * @li @ref elm_transit_effect_zoom_add
 * @li @ref elm_transit_effect_resizing_add
 *
 * Other transition effects are used to make one object disappear and another
 * object appear on its place. These effects are:
 *
 * @li @ref elm_transit_effect_flip_add
 * @li @ref elm_transit_effect_resizable_flip_add
 * @li @ref elm_transit_effect_fade_add
 * @li @ref elm_transit_effect_blend_add
 *
 * It's also possible to make a transition chain with @ref
 * elm_transit_chain_transit_add.
 *
 * @warning We strongly recommend to use elm_transit just when edje can not do
 * the trick. Edje is better at handling transitions than Elm_Transit.
 * Edje has more flexibility and animations can be manipulated inside the theme.
 *
 * List of examples:
 * @li @ref transit_example_01_explained
 * @li @ref transit_example_02_explained
 * @li @ref transit_example_03_c
 * @li @ref transit_example_04_c
