 * are "active" for flipping and how much space they use (a minimum of a finger
 * size) with @ref Efl.Ui.Flip.interaction_direction_enabled_set and
 * @ref Efl.Ui.Flip.interaction_direction_hitsize_set.
 *
 * The four available mode of interaction are #ELM_FLIP_INTERACTION_NONE,
 * #ELM_FLIP_INTERACTION_ROTATE, #ELM_FLIP_INTERACTION_CUBE and
 *  #ELM_FLIP_INTERACTION_PAGE.
 *
 * @note #ELM_FLIP_INTERACTION_ROTATE won't cause
