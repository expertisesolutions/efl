 *
 * This widget is an enhancement of @ref Notify. In addition to
 * content area, there are two optional sections, namely title area and
 * action area.
 *
 * The popup widget displays its content with a particular orientation in
 * the parent area. This orientation can be one among top, center,
 * bottom, left, top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right.
 * Content part of Popup can be an Evas Object set by application or
 * it can be Text set by application or set of items containing an
 * icon and/or text. The content/item-list can be removed using
 * elm_object_content_set with second parameter passed as NULL.
 *
 * The following figures show the textual layouts of popup in which Title
 * Area and Action area are optional ones. Action area can have
 * up to 3 buttons handled using elm_object common APIs mentioned
 * below. If user wants to have more than 3 buttons then these buttons
 * can be put inside the items of a list as content. User needs to
 * handle the clicked signal of these action buttons if required. No
 * event is processed by the widget automatically when clicked on
 * these action buttons.

 *
 * Timeout can be set on expiry of which popup instance hides and
 * sends a smart signal "timeout" to the user. The visible region of
 * popup is surrounded by a translucent region called Blocked Event
 * area. By clicking on Blocked Event area, the signal
 * "block,clicked" is sent to the application. This block event area
 * can be avoided by using API elm_popup_allow_events_set. When gets
 * hidden, popup does not get destroyed automatically, application
 * should destroy the popup instance after use. To control the
 * maximum height of the internal scroller for item, we use the height
 * of the action area which is passed by theme based on the number of
 * buttons currently set to popup.
 *
 * Popup sets the focus to itself when evas_object_show is called on popup.
 * To set the focus into popup's contents and buttons automatically,
 * evas_object_show on popup should be called after setting all the contents
 * and buttons of popup.
 *
 * This widget inherits from the @ref Elm_Layout one, so that all the
 * functions acting on it also work for popup objects (since 1.8).
 *
 * This widget emits the following signals, besides the ones sent from
 * @ref Elm_Layout :
 * @li @c "timeout" - whenever popup is closed as a result of timeout.
 * @li @c "block,clicked" - whenever user taps on Blocked Event area.
 * @li @c "focused" - When the popup has received focus. (since 1.8)
 * @li @c "unfocused" - When the popup has lost focus. (since 1.8)
 * @li "language,changed" - the program's language changed (since 1.8)
 * @li "item,focused" - When the popup item has received focus. (since 1.10)
 * @li "item,unfocused" - When the popup item has lost focus. (since 1.10)
