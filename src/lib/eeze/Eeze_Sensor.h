/**
 * @file Eeze_Sensor.h
 * @brief Sensor information subsystem
 *
 * Eeze sensor functions allow you to gather sensor information from different
 * sensor sources available on your hardware. It supports a plugin architecture
 * to support different hardware platforms and devices. These plugins can be
 * loaded at runtime.
 *
 * Right now we have support for the Tizen sensor framework as well as a simple
 * fake plugin to be used as a test harness for development. Plugins for other
 * sensor frameworks or platforms are always welcome.
 *
 * Synchronous as well as asynchronous reads are possible. As reading the
 * physical sensor might be bound to a high latency and thus cost the value of
 * the last read is cached within Eeze_Sensor together with a timestamp of the
 * actual read out. This can speed up the value access for application while the
 * values are still getting updating asynchronously in the background. The
 * timestamp should be checked if the specific time requirements are needed.
 *
 * As an alternative the sensor could be read synchronously. With the
 * disadvantage that the function call will block until the data is read from
 * the sensor.
 *
 * @since 1.8
 *
 * @addtogroup Eeze_Sensor Sensor
 * Gather sensor information from different sources. Works based on plugins,
 * with a Tizen plugin being available.
