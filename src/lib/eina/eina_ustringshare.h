/**
 * @addtogroup Eina_UStringshare_Group Unicode Stringshare
 *
 * These functions allow you to store one copy of a string, and use it
 * throughout your program.
 *
 * This is a method to reduce the number of duplicated strings kept in
 * memory. It's pretty common for the same strings to be dynamically
 * allocated repeatedly between applications and libraries, especially in
 * circumstances where you could have multiple copies of a structure that
 * allocates the string. So rather than duplicating and freeing these
 * strings, you request a read-only pointer to an existing string and
 * only incur the overhead of a hash lookup.
 *
 * It sounds like micro-optimizing, but profiling has shown this can have
 * a significant impact as you scale the number of copies up. It improves
 * string creation/destruction speed, reduces memory use and decreases
 * memory fragmentation, so a win all-around.
 *
 * For more information, you can look at the @ref tutorial_ustringshare_page.
