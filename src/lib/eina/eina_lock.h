/**
 * @defgroup Eina_Lock_Group Lock
 * @ingroup Eina_Tools_Group
 * @brief This group provides thread locking and synchronization capabilities.
 *
 * Similar to POSIX threads (pthreads), but it takes care of the platform specific
 * details so you don't have to.
 *
 * If you know how @c pthreads work, this library will look familiar to you.
 * If you are not familiar with @c pthreads, a good overview is available
 * <a href="https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/pthreads/">here</a>
 *
 * The Eina lock functions are grouped into several categories to handle different
 * thread locking and synchronization methods:
 * @li eina_lock_* - Functions that implement locking.
 * @li eina_condition_* - Functions that implement condition variables.
 * @li eina_rwlock_* - Functions that implement read/write locks.
 * @li eina_tls_* - Functions that implement thread level storage.
 * @li eina_semaphore_* - Functions that implement semaphores.
 * @li eina_barrier_* - Functions that implement barriers.
 * @li eina_spinlock_* - Functions that implement spinlocks if they are available
 * on the platform.  If they are not available, these functions degrade to plain locks.
