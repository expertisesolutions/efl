/**
 * @page eina_inarray_example_01 Eina inline array usage
 * @dontinclude eina_inarray_01.c
 *
 * This example will create an inline array of chars, add some elements, print
 * it, re-purpose the array to store ints, add some elements and print that.
 *
 * We'll start with a function to compare ints we need this because the '>'
 * operator is not a function and can't be used where Eina_Compare_Cb is needed.
 * @skip int
 * @until }
 *
 * And then move on to the code we actually care about, starting with variable
 * declarations and eina initialization:
 * @until eina_init
 *
 * Creating an inline array is very simple, we just need to know what type we
 * want to store:
 * @until inarray_new
 * @note The second parameter(the step) is left at zero which means that eina
 * will choose an appropriate value, this should @b only be changed if it's
 * known, beforehand, how many elements the array will have.
 *
 * Once we have an array we can start adding elements to it. Because the
 * insertion function expect a memory address we have to put the value we want
 * to store in a variable(this should be no problem since in real world usage
 * that's usually where the value will be anyways):
 * @until push
 * @note Because the inline array copies the value given to it we can later
 * change @c ch, which we do, without affecting the contents of the array.
 *
 * So let's add some more elements:
 * @until push
 * @until push
 * @until push
 *
 * We will then iterate over our array and print every position of it. The thing
 * to note here is not so much the values which will be the expected 'a', 'b',
 * 'c' and 'd', but rather the memory address of these values, they are
 * sequential:
 * @until printf
 * @until printf
 *
 * We'll now use our array to store ints, so we need to first erase every member
 * currently on the array:
 * @until _flush
 *
 * And then to be able to store a different type on the same array we use the
 * eina_inarray_step_set() function, which is just like the eina_inarray_new()
 * function except it receives already allocated memory. This time we're going
 * to ask eina to use a step of size 4 because that's how many elements we'll be
 * putting on the array:
 * @until _step_set
 * @note Strictly speaking the reason to call eina_inarray_step_set() is not
 * because we're storing different type, but rather because our types have
 * different sizes. Eina inline arrays don't actually know anything about types,
 * they only deal in blocks of memory of a given size.
 * @note Since eina_inarray_step_set() receives already allocated memory you can(and
 * it is in fact good practice) use inline arrays not declared as pointers:
 * @code
 * Eina_Inarray arr;
 * eina_inarray_step_set(&arr, sizeof(arr), sizeof(int), 4);
 * @endcode
 *
 * And now to add our integer values to the array:
 * @until push
 * @until push
 * @until push
 *
 * Just to change things up a bit we've left out the 99 value, but will still
 * add it in such a way to keep the array ordered. There are many ways to do
 * this, we could use eina_inarray_insert_at(), or we could change the value
 * of the last member using eina_inarray_replace_at() and then append the values
 * in the right order, but for no particular reason we're going to use
 * eina_inarray_insert_sorted() instead:
 * @until insert_sorted
 *
 * We then print the size of our array, and the array itself, much like last
 * time the values are not surprising, and neither should it be that the memory
 * addresses are contiguous:
 * @until printf
 * @until printf
 *
 * Once done we free our array and shutdown eina:
 * @until }

 * This example will create an inline array of strings, add some elements and

 * @ref eina_inarray_example_01.
 *
 * We start with some variable declarations and eina initialization:
 * @skip int
 * @until eina_init
 *
 * We then create the array much like we did on @ref eina_inarray_example_01 :
 * @until inarray_new
 *
 * The point were this example significantly differs from the first eina inline
 * array example. We'll not be adding the strings themselves to the array since
 * their size varies, we'll store pointer to the strings instead. We therefore
 * use @c char** to populate our inline array:

 * @warning Do not modify array as you walk it! If that is desired,
