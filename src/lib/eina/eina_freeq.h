/**
 * @addtogroup Eina_FreeQ_Group Free Queue Group
 * @ingroup Eina
 *
 * @brief This provides a mechanism to defer actual freeing of memory
 * data at some time in the future. The main free queue will be driven
 * by the EFL main loop and ensure data is eventually freed.
 *
 * For debugging and tuning you may set the following environment variables,
 * applicable only to free queues of the default type:
 *
 * EINA_FREEQ_BYPASS=1/0
 *
 * Set this environment variable to 1 to immediately bypass the free queue and
 * have all items submitted free with their free function immediately. Set
 * it to 0 to force the free queue to work and delay freeing of items.
 * Note that you can override this by setting count or mem max by
 * eina_freeq_count_max_set() or eina_freeq_mem_max_set() which will
 * disable bypass for that specific free queue. Once bypass is disabled
 * it cannot be re-enabled.
 *
 * EINA_FREEQ_FILL_MAX=N
 *
 * This sets the maximum number of bytes to N an item in the free queue may
 * be in size for the free queue to fill it with debugging values like
 * 0x55 in every byte, to ensure you can see what memory has been freed
 * or not when debugging in tools like gdb. Note that this value is
 * actually one greater than the actual maximum, so if this is set to 100
 * a memory blob of 100 bytes will not be filled but one of 99 bytes in
 * size will be.
 *
 * EINA_FREEQ_TOTAL_MAX=N
 *
 * This sets the maximum number of items allowed to N on a free queue by
 * default before it starts emptying the free queue out to make room.
 *
 * EINA_FREEQ_MEM_MAX=N
 *
 * This sets the maximum total number of Kb (Kilobytes) of memory allowed
 * on a free queue by default to N Kb worth of data.
 *
 * EINA_FREEQ_FILL=N
 *
 * This sets the byte value to write to every byte of an allocation that
 * is added to the free queue when it is added to mark the data as invalid.
 * The default value is 0x55 (85). Memory is only filled if the size of
 * the allocation is less than the max that you can adjust with
 * EINA_FREEQ_FILL_MAX.
 *
 * EINA_FREEQ_FILL_FREED=N
 *
 * Memory just before it is actually passed to the free function to be freed
 * will be filled with this pattern value in every byte. The default value
 * is 0x77 (119). Memory is only filled if the size of the allocation is
 * less than the max that you can adjust with EINA_FREEQ_FILL_MAX.

 * @param[in] size The size of the data the pointer points to
 *
 * This adds the given @p ptr pointer to the queue to be freed later on.
 * The function @p free_func will be used, or if this is NULL, it is assumed
 * the libc free() function will be used then instead. The @p size parameter
 * determines the size of the data pointed to, but if this is 0 then no
 * assumptions are made about size and the pointer is considered opaque. A
 * zero sized pointer will not contribute to the total memory usage of
 * items in the queue as well. If @p size is supplied it must be correct
 * as the memory may be written to for debugging purposes or otherwise
 * inspected or checksummed. Once a pointer is added to the free queue
 * with this API the memory should be considered freed as if the real
 * @p free_func was called immediately (and it may actually be called
 * immediately if certain environment variables are set). A free queue exists
 * to move the cost of freeing to another point in time when it is more
 * convenient to do so as well as provide some robustness for badly
 * written code that may access memory after freeing. Note that when using
 * tools like valgrind, eina detects this and will also immediately free
 * the data so valgrind's own memory checkers can detect use after free
 * as normal.
 *
 * Note: The free function must not access the CONTENT of the memory to be
 * freed, or at least consider it invalid and full of garbage. It is already
 * invalid at the moment it is added to the free queue. Just the actual
 * free function may be delayed. The free function may also not access other
 * memory already freed before being added to the free queue. They may do
 * tricks like use memory headers that are outside the memory region to be
 * freed (pass in pointer char *x, then char *header_address = x - 16 to get
 * header information) as this header is not considered part of the free data.
 * This note does not apply if you use a size of 0 for the pointer, but then
 * you lose canary debugging ability when using 0 sized pointers on the free
 * queue.
