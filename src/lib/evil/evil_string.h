/**
 * @brief Implements the strsep function which is used to separate strings.
 *
 * @param stringp The pointer to the string to search in.
 * @param delim The delimiter that contains characters used to find the next token.
 * @return a pointer to the next token or NULL;
 *
 * The strsep() function locates, in the string referenced by *stringp, the
 * first occurrence of any character in the string delim (or the terminating
 * `\0' character) and replaces it with a `\0'.  The location of the next
 * character after the delimiter character (or NULL, if the end of the
 * string was reached) is stored in *stringp.  The original value of
 * stringp is returned.
 *
 * An ``empty'' field (i.e., a character in the string delim occurs as the
 * first character of *stringp) can be detected by comparing the location
 * referenced by the returned pointer to `\0'.

 * If *stringp is initially NULL, strsep() returns NULL.
 *
 * This function is from LibGW32C.
 * @since 1.8
