 *
 * Ecore evas is a set of functions that make it easy to tie together ecore's
 * main loop and input handling to evas. As such it's a natural base for EFL
 * applications. While this combination makes it easy to create the basic
 * aspects all applications need, for normal applications(ones with buttons,
 * checkboxes and layouts) one should consider using Elementary.
 *
 * Ecore evas is extremely well suited for applications that are not based on
 * widgets. It has a main loop that delivers events, does basic window handling
 * and leaves all of the drawing up to the user. This works very well if used
 * in conjunction with Edje or if doing custom drawing as, for example, is done
 * in games.
 *
 * This is a list of examples of these functions:
 * @li @ref ecore_evas_basics_example_c
 * @li @ref ecore_evas_object_example_c
 * @li @ref ecore_evas_callbacks_example_c
 * @li @ref Ecore_Evas_Window_Sizes_Example_c
 * @li @ref Ecore_Evas_Buffer_Example_01_c

 * must use ecore_evas_callback_delete_request_set() and set your own code,

 * and still want to delete the window/object, you must do that yourself.
 *
 * Since we now define delete_request, deleting windows will not quit
 * main loop, if you wish to do so, you should listen for EVAS_CALLBACK_FREE

 * @li ECORE_EVAS_OBJECT_ASSOCIATE_STACK: stacking operations will act
 *     on the Ecore_Evas, not the object. So evas_object_raise() will
 *     call ecore_evas_raise(). Relative operations (stack_above, stack_below)
 *     are still not implemented.
 * @li ECORE_EVAS_OBJECT_ASSOCIATE_LAYER: stacking operations will act
 *     on the Ecore_Evas, not the object. So evas_object_layer_set() will
