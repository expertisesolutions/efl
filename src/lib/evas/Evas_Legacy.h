 * Add (register) a callback function to a given canvas event.

 * @param type The type of event that will trigger the callback
 * @param func The (callback) function to be called when the event is
 *        triggered
 * @param data The data pointer to be passed to @p func
 *
 * This function adds a function callback to the canvas @p e when the
 * event of type @p type occurs on it. The function pointer is @p
 * func.
 *
 * In the event of a memory allocation error during the addition of
 * the callback to the canvas, evas_alloc_error() should be used to
 * determine the nature of the error, if any, and the program should
 * sensibly try and recover.
 *
 * A callback function must have the ::Evas_Event_Cb prototype
 * definition. The first parameter (@p data) in this definition will
 * have the same value passed to evas_event_callback_add() as the @p
 * data parameter, at runtime. The second parameter @p e is the canvas
 * pointer on which the event occurred. The third parameter @p
 * event_info is a pointer to a data structure that may or may not be
 * passed to the callback, depending on the event type that triggered
 * the callback. This is so because some events don't carry extra
 * context with them, but others do.
 *
 * The event type @p type to trigger the function may be one of
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_RENDER_FLUSH_PRE, #EVAS_CALLBACK_RENDER_FLUSH_POST,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_CANVAS_FOCUS_IN, #EVAS_CALLBACK_CANVAS_FOCUS_OUT,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_CANVAS_OBJECT_FOCUS_IN and
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_CANVAS_OBJECT_FOCUS_OUT. This determines the kind of
 * event that will trigger the callback to be called. Only the last
 * two of the event types listed here provide useful event information
 * data -- a pointer to the recently focused Evas object. For the
 * others the @p event_info pointer is going to be @c NULL.
 *
 * Example:
 * @dontinclude evas-events.c
 * @skip evas_event_callback_add(d.canvas, EVAS_CALLBACK_RENDER_FLUSH_PRE
 * @until two canvas event callbacks
 *
 * Looking to the callbacks registered above,
 * @dontinclude evas-events.c
 * @skip called when our rectangle gets focus
 * @until let's have our events back
 *
 * we see that the canvas flushes its rendering pipeline
 * (#EVAS_CALLBACK_RENDER_FLUSH_PRE) whenever the @c _resize_cb
 * routine takes place: it has to redraw that image at a different
 * size. Also, the callback on an object being focused comes just
 * after we focus it explicitly, on code.
 *
 * See the full @ref Example_Evas_Events "example".
 *
 * @note Be careful not to add the same callback multiple times, if
 * that's not what you want, because Evas won't check if a callback
 * existed before exactly as the one being registered (and thus, call
 * it more than once on the event, in this case). This would make

 * This function will clip the object @p obj to the area occupied by

 * visible within the area occupied by the clipping object (@p clip).
 *
 * The color of the object being clipped will be multiplied by the
 * color of the clipping one, so the resulting color for the former
 * will be <code>RESULT = (OBJ * CLIP) / (255 * 255)</code>, per color
 * element (red, green, blue and alpha).
 *
 * Clipping is recursive, so clipping objects may be clipped by
 * others, and their color will in term be multiplied. You may @b not
 * set up circular clipping lists (i.e. object 1 clips object 2, which
 * clips object 1): the behavior of Evas is undefined in this case.
 *
 * Objects which do not clip others are visible in the canvas as
 * normal; <b>those that clip one or more objects become invisible
 * themselves</b>, only affecting what they clip. If an object ceases
 * to have other objects being clipped by it, it will become visible
 * again.
 *
 * The visibility of an object affects the objects that are clipped by
 * it, so if the object clipping others is not shown (as in
 * evas_object_show()), the objects clipped by it will not be shown
 * either.
 *
 * If @p obj was being clipped by another object when this function is
 * called, it gets implicitly removed from the old clipper's domain
 * and is made now to be clipped by its new clipper.

/**
 * Add (register) a callback function to a given Evas object event.
 *
 * @param obj Object to attach a callback to
 * @param type The type of event that will trigger the callback
 * @param func The function to be called when the event is triggered
 * @param data The data pointer to be passed to @p func
 *
 * This function adds a function callback to an object when the event
 * of type @p type occurs on object @p obj. The function is @p func.
 *
 * In the event of a memory allocation error during addition of the
 * callback to the object, evas_alloc_error() should be used to
 * determine the nature of the error, if any, and the program should
 * sensibly try and recover.
 *
 * A callback function must have the ::Evas_Object_Event_Cb prototype
 * definition. The first parameter (@p data) in this definition will
 * have the same value passed to evas_object_event_callback_add() as
 * the @p data parameter, at runtime. The second parameter @p e is the
 * canvas pointer on which the event occurred. The third parameter is
 * a pointer to the object on which event occurred. Finally, the
 * fourth parameter @p event_info is a pointer to a data structure
 * that may or may not be passed to the callback, depending on the
 * event type that triggered the callback. This is so because some
 * events don't carry extra context with them, but others do.
 *
 * The event type @p type to trigger the function may be one of
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_IN, #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_OUT,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_DOWN, #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_UP,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_MOVE, #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_WHEEL,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_MULTI_DOWN, #EVAS_CALLBACK_MULTI_UP,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_MULTI_MOVE, #EVAS_CALLBACK_FREE,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_KEY_DOWN, #EVAS_CALLBACK_KEY_UP,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_FOCUS_IN, #EVAS_CALLBACK_FOCUS_OUT,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_SHOW, #EVAS_CALLBACK_HIDE, #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOVE,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_RESIZE, #EVAS_CALLBACK_RESTACK, #EVAS_CALLBACK_DEL,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_HOLD, #EVAS_CALLBACK_CHANGED_SIZE_HINTS,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_IMAGE_PRELOADED or #EVAS_CALLBACK_IMAGE_UNLOADED.
 *
 * This determines the kind of event that will trigger the callback.
 * What follows is a list explaining better the nature of each type of
 * event, along with their associated @p event_info pointers:
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_IN: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_In struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered when the mouse pointer enters the area
 *   (not shaded by other objects) of the object @p obj. This may
 *   occur by the mouse pointer being moved by
 *   evas_event_feed_mouse_move() calls, or by the object being shown,
 *   raised, moved, resized, or other objects being moved out of the
 *   way, hidden or lowered, whatever may cause the mouse pointer to
 *   get on top of @p obj, having been on top of another object
 *   previously.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_OUT: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_Out struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered exactly like #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_IN is,
 *   but it occurs when the mouse pointer exits an object's area. Note
 *   that no mouse out events will be reported if the mouse pointer is
 *   implicitly grabbed to an object (mouse buttons are down, having
 *   been pressed while the pointer was over that object). In these
 *   cases, mouse out events will be reported once all buttons are
 *   released, if the mouse pointer has left the object's area. The
 *   indirect ways of taking off the mouse pointer from an object,
 *   like cited above, for #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_IN, also apply here,
 *   naturally.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_DOWN: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_Down struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered by a mouse button being pressed while the
 *   mouse pointer is over an object. If the pointer mode for Evas is
 *   #EVAS_OBJECT_POINTER_MODE_AUTOGRAB (default), this causes this
 *   object to <b>passively grab the mouse</b> until all mouse buttons
 *   have been released: all future mouse events will be reported to
 *   only this object until no buttons are down. That includes mouse
 *   move events, mouse in and mouse out events, and further button
 *   presses. When all buttons are released, event propagation will
 *   occur as normal (see #Evas_Object_Pointer_Mode).
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_UP: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_Up struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered by a mouse button being released while
 *   the mouse pointer is over an object's area (or when passively
 *   grabbed to an object).
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_MOVE: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_Move struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered by the mouse pointer being moved while
 *   over an object's area (or while passively grabbed to an object).
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_WHEEL: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_Wheel struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered by the mouse wheel being rolled while the
 *   mouse pointer is over an object (or passively grabbed to an
 *   object).
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MULTI_DOWN: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Multi_Down struct
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MULTI_UP: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Multi_Up struct
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MULTI_MOVE: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Multi_Move struct
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_FREE: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered just before Evas is about to free all
 *   memory used by an object and remove all references to it. This is
 *   useful for programs to use if they attached data to an object and
 *   want to free it when the object is deleted. The object is still
 *   valid when this callback is called, but after it returns, there
 *   is no guarantee on the object's validity.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_KEY_DOWN: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Key_Down struct\n\n
 *   This callback is called when a key is pressed and the focus is on
 *   the object, or a key has been grabbed to a particular object
 *   which wants to intercept the key press regardless of what object
 *   has the focus.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_KEY_UP: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Key_Up struct \n\n
 *   This callback is called when a key is released and the focus is
 *   on the object, or a key has been grabbed to a particular object
 *   which wants to intercept the key release regardless of what
 *   object has the focus.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_FOCUS_IN: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is called when an object gains the focus. When it is
 *   called the object has already gained the focus.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_FOCUS_OUT: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered when an object loses the focus. When it
 *   is called the object has already lost the focus.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_SHOW: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered by the object being shown by
 *   evas_object_show().
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_HIDE: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered by an object being hidden by
 *   evas_object_hide().
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOVE: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered by an object being
 *   moved. evas_object_move() can trigger this, as can any
 *   object-specific manipulations that would mean the object's origin
 *   could move.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_RESIZE: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered by an object being resized. Resizes can
 *   be triggered by evas_object_resize() or by any object-specific
 *   calls that may cause the object to resize.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_RESTACK: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered by an object being re-stacked. Stacking
 *   changes can be triggered by
 *   evas_object_stack_below()/evas_object_stack_above() and others.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_DEL: @p event_info is @c NULL.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_HOLD: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Hold struct
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_CHANGED_SIZE_HINTS: @p event_info is @c NULL.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_IMAGE_PRELOADED: @p event_info is @c NULL.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_IMAGE_UNLOADED: @p event_info is @c NULL.
 *
 * @note Be careful not to add the same callback multiple times, if
 * that's not what you want, because Evas won't check if a callback
 * existed before exactly as the one being registered (and thus, call
 * it more than once on the event, in this case). This would make
 * sense if you passed different functions and/or callback data, only.
 *
 * Example:
 * @dontinclude evas-events.c
 * @skip evas_object_event_callback_add(
 * @until }

 * its padding/alignment properties, which are set by the
 * <c>evas_object_box_{h,v}_{align,padding}_set()</c> family of
 * functions. The size hints of the elements in the box -- set by the
 * <c>evas_object_size_hint_{align,padding,weight}_set()</c> functions
 * -- also control the way this function works.
 *
 * \par Box's properties:
 * @c align_h controls the horizontal alignment of the child objects
 * relative to the containing box. When set to @c 0.0, children are
 * aligned to the left. A value of @c 1.0 makes them aligned to the
 * right border. Values in between align them proportionally. Note
 * that if the size required by the children, which is given by their
 * widths and the @c padding_h property of the box, is bigger than the
 * their container's width, the children will be displayed out of the
 * box's bounds. A negative value of @c align_h makes the box to
 * @b justify its children. The padding between them, in this case, is
 * corrected so that the leftmost one touches the left border and the
 * rightmost one touches the right border (even if they must
 * overlap). The @c align_v and @c padding_v properties of the box
 * @b don't contribute to its behaviour when this layout is chosen.
 *
 * \par Child element's properties:
 * @c align_x does @b not influence the box's behavior. @c padding_l
 * and @c padding_r sum up to the container's horizontal padding
 * between elements. The child's @c padding_t, @c padding_b and
 * @c align_y properties apply for padding/alignment relative to the
 * overall height of the box. Finally, there is the @c weight_x
 * property, which, if set to a non-zero value, tells the container
 * that the child width is @b not pre-defined. If the container can't
 * accommodate all its children, it sets the widths of the ones
 * <b>with weights</b> to sizes as small as they can all fit into
 * it. If the size required by the children is less than the
 * available, the box increases its childrens' (which have weights)
 * widths as to fit the remaining space. The @c weight_x property,
 * besides telling the element is resizable, gives a @b weight for the
 * resizing process.  The parent box will try to distribute (or take
 * off) widths accordingly to the @b normalized list of weigths: most
 * weighted children remain/get larger in this process than the least
 * ones. @c weight_y does not influence the layout.
 *
 * If one desires that, besides having weights, child elements must be
 * resized bounded to a minimum or maximum size, those size hints must
 * be set, by the <c>evas_object_size_hint_{min,max}_set()</c>
 * functions.

 * alignment will be considered as 0.5. This is the default.
 *
 * @todo @c EVAS_OBJECT_TABLE_HOMOGENEOUS_NONE should balance weight.
 *
 * @par EVAS_OBJECT_TABLE_HOMOGENEOUS_TABLE
 * When homogeneous is relative to table the own table size is divided
 * equally among children, filling the whole table area. That is, if
 * table has @c WIDTH and @c COLUMNS, each cell will get <tt>WIDTH /
 * COLUMNS</tt> pixels. If children have minimum size that is larger
 * than this amount (including padding), then it will overflow and be
 * aligned respecting the alignment hint, possible overlapping sibling
 * cells. @b Weight hint is used as a boolean, if greater than zero it
 * will make the child expand in that axis, taking as much space as
 * possible (bounded to maximum size hint). Negative alignment will be
 * considered as 0.5.
 *
 * @par EVAS_OBJECT_TABLE_HOMOGENEOUS_ITEM
 * When homogeneous is relative to item it means the greatest minimum
 * cell size will be used. That is, if no element is set to expand,
 * the table will have its contents to a minimum size, the bounding
 * box of all these children will be aligned relatively to the table
 * object using evas_object_table_align_get(). If the table area is
 * too small to hold this minimum bounding box, then the objects will
 * keep their size and the bounding box will overflow the box area,
 * still respecting the alignment. @b Weight hint is used as a
 * boolean, if greater than zero it will make that cell expand in that
 * axis, toggling the <b>expand mode</b>, which makes the table behave
 * much like @b EVAS_OBJECT_TABLE_HOMOGENEOUS_TABLE, except that the
 * bounding box will overflow and items will not overlap siblings. If
 * no minimum size is provided at all then the table will fallback to
