/**
 * Add (register) a callback function to a given canvas event.
 *
 * @param e Canvas to attach a callback to
 * @param type The type of event that will trigger the callback
 * @param func The (callback) function to be called when the event is
 *        triggered
 * @param data The data pointer to be passed to @p func
 *
 * This function adds a function callback to the canvas @p e when the
 * event of type @p type occurs on it. The function pointer is @p
 * func.
 *
 * In the event of a memory allocation error during the addition of
 * the callback to the canvas, evas_alloc_error() should be used to
 * determine the nature of the error, if any, and the program should
 * sensibly try and recover.
 *
 * A callback function must have the ::Evas_Event_Cb prototype
 * definition. The first parameter (@p data) in this definition will
 * have the same value passed to evas_event_callback_add() as the @p
 * data parameter, at runtime. The second parameter @p e is the canvas
 * pointer on which the event occurred. The third parameter @p
 * event_info is a pointer to a data structure that may or may not be
 * passed to the callback, depending on the event type that triggered
 * the callback. This is so because some events don't carry extra
 * context with them, but others do.
 *
 * The event type @p type to trigger the function may be one of
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_RENDER_FLUSH_PRE, #EVAS_CALLBACK_RENDER_FLUSH_POST,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_CANVAS_FOCUS_IN, #EVAS_CALLBACK_CANVAS_FOCUS_OUT,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_CANVAS_OBJECT_FOCUS_IN and
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_CANVAS_OBJECT_FOCUS_OUT. This determines the kind of
 * event that will trigger the callback to be called. Only the last
 * two of the event types listed here provide useful event information
 * data -- a pointer to the recently focused Evas object. For the
 * others the @p event_info pointer is going to be @c NULL.
 *
 * Example:
 * @dontinclude evas-events.c
 * @skip evas_event_callback_add(d.canvas, EVAS_CALLBACK_RENDER_FLUSH_PRE
 * @until two canvas event callbacks
 *
 * Looking to the callbacks registered above,
 * @dontinclude evas-events.c
 * @skip called when our rectangle gets focus
 * @until let's have our events back
 *
 * we see that the canvas flushes its rendering pipeline
 * (#EVAS_CALLBACK_RENDER_FLUSH_PRE) whenever the @c _resize_cb
 * routine takes place: it has to redraw that image at a different
 * size. Also, the callback on an object being focused comes just
 * after we focus it explicitly, on code.
 *
 * See the full @ref Example_Evas_Events "example".
 *
 * @note Be careful not to add the same callback multiple times, if
 * that's not what you want, because Evas won't check if a callback
 * existed before exactly as the one being registered (and thus, call
 * it more than once on the event, in this case). This would make
 * sense if you passed different functions and/or callback data, only.

 * in each object triggered). When all these have been called, the stack is
 * unwound from most recently to least recently pushed item and removed from the
 * stack calling the callback set for it.
 *
 * This is intended for doing reverse logic-like processing, example - when a
 * child object that happens to get the event later is meant to be able to
 * "steal" functions from a parent and thus on unwind of this stack have its
 * function called first, thus being able to set flags, or return 0 from the
 * post-callback that stops all other post-callbacks in the current stack from
 * being called (thus basically allowing a child to take control, if the event
 * callback prepares information ready for taking action, but the post callback
 * actually does the action).
 *
 * This function should only be called from inside an evas input event
 * callback. The event_info data may be kept up until @p func is called, in
 * order to check the state of the "on-hold" flag for instance. Do not modify
 * the canvas or otherwise trigger or feed a events to the canvas from inside
 * @p func. Use jobs to safely modify the canvas.

 *
 * In the event of a memory allocation error during addition of the
 * callback to the object, evas_alloc_error() should be used to
 * determine the nature of the error, if any, and the program should
 * sensibly try and recover.
 *
 * A callback function must have the ::Evas_Object_Event_Cb prototype
 * definition. The first parameter (@p data) in this definition will
 * have the same value passed to evas_object_event_callback_add() as
 * the @p data parameter, at runtime. The second parameter @p e is the
 * canvas pointer on which the event occurred. The third parameter is
 * a pointer to the object on which event occurred. Finally, the
 * fourth parameter @p event_info is a pointer to a data structure
 * that may or may not be passed to the callback, depending on the
 * event type that triggered the callback. This is so because some
 * events don't carry extra context with them, but others do.
 *
 * The event type @p type to trigger the function may be one of
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_IN, #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_OUT,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_DOWN, #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_UP,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_MOVE, #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_WHEEL,

 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_HOLD, #EVAS_CALLBACK_CHANGED_SIZE_HINTS,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_IMAGE_PRELOADED or #EVAS_CALLBACK_IMAGE_UNLOADED.
 *
 * This determines the kind of event that will trigger the callback.
 * What follows is a list explaining better the nature of each type of
 * event, along with their associated @p event_info pointers:
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_IN: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_In struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered when the mouse pointer enters the area
 *   (not shaded by other objects) of the object @p obj. This may
 *   occur by the mouse pointer being moved by
 *   evas_event_feed_mouse_move() calls, or by the object being shown,
 *   raised, moved, resized, or other objects being moved out of the
 *   way, hidden or lowered, whatever may cause the mouse pointer to
 *   get on top of @p obj, having been on top of another object
 *   previously.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_OUT: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_Out struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered exactly like #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_IN is,
 *   but it occurs when the mouse pointer exits an object's area. Note
 *   that no mouse out events will be reported if the mouse pointer is
 *   implicitly grabbed to an object (mouse buttons are down, having
 *   been pressed while the pointer was over that object). In these
 *   cases, mouse out events will be reported once all buttons are
 *   released, if the mouse pointer has left the object's area. The
 *   indirect ways of taking off the mouse pointer from an object,
 *   like cited above, for #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_IN, also apply here,
 *   naturally.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_DOWN: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_Down struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered by a mouse button being pressed while the
 *   mouse pointer is over an object. If the pointer mode for Evas is
 *   #EVAS_OBJECT_POINTER_MODE_AUTOGRAB (default), this causes this
 *   object to <b>passively grab the mouse</b> until all mouse buttons
 *   have been released: all future mouse events will be reported to
 *   only this object until no buttons are down. That includes mouse
 *   move events, mouse in and mouse out events, and further button
 *   presses. When all buttons are released, event propagation will
 *   occur as normal (see #Evas_Object_Pointer_Mode).
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_UP: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_Up struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered by a mouse button being released while
 *   the mouse pointer is over an object's area (or when passively
 *   grabbed to an object).
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_MOVE: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_Move struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered by the mouse pointer being moved while
 *   over an object's area (or while passively grabbed to an object).
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_WHEEL: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_Wheel struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered by the mouse wheel being rolled while the
 *   mouse pointer is over an object (or passively grabbed to an
 *   object).
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MULTI_DOWN: @p event_info is a pointer to an

 *   #Evas_Event_Axis_Update struct
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_FREE: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered just before Evas is about to free all
 *   memory used by an object and remove all references to it. This is
 *   useful for programs to use if they attached data to an object and
 *   want to free it when the object is deleted. The object is still
 *   valid when this callback is called, but after it returns, there
 *   is no guarantee on the object's validity.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_KEY_DOWN: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Key_Down struct\n\n
 *   This callback is called when a key is pressed and the focus is on
 *   the object, or a key has been grabbed to a particular object
 *   which wants to intercept the key press regardless of what object
 *   has the focus.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_KEY_UP: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Key_Up struct \n\n
 *   This callback is called when a key is released and the focus is
 *   on the object, or a key has been grabbed to a particular object
 *   which wants to intercept the key release regardless of what
 *   object has the focus.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_FOCUS_IN: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is called when an object gains the focus. When it is
 *   called the object has already gained the focus.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_FOCUS_OUT: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered when an object loses the focus. When it
 *   is called the object has already lost the focus.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_SHOW: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered by the object being shown by
 *   evas_object_show().
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_HIDE: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered by an object being hidden by
 *   evas_object_hide().
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOVE: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered by an object being
 *   moved. evas_object_move() can trigger this, as can any
 *   object-specific manipulations that would mean the object's origin
 *   could move.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_RESIZE: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered by an object being resized. Resizes can
 *   be triggered by evas_object_resize() or by any object-specific
 *   calls that may cause the object to resize.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_RESTACK: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered by an object being re-stacked. Stacking
 *   changes can be triggered by
 *   evas_object_stack_below()/evas_object_stack_above() and others.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_DEL: @p event_info is @c NULL.

 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_IMAGE_UNLOADED: @p event_info is @c NULL.
 *
 * @note Be careful not to add the same callback multiple times, if
 * that's not what you want, because Evas won't check if a callback
 * existed before exactly as the one being registered (and thus, call
 * it more than once on the event, in this case). This would make
 * sense if you passed different functions and/or callback data, only.
 *
 * Example:

 * @skip evas_object_event_callback_add(
 * @until }

/**
 * @defgroup Evas_Object_Group_Map UV Mapping (Rotation, Perspective, 3D...)
 *
 * Evas allows different transformations to be applied to all kinds of
 * objects. These are applied by means of UV mapping.
 *
 * With UV mapping, one maps points in the source object to a 3D space
 * positioning at target. This allows rotation, perspective, scale and
 * lots of other effects, depending on the map that is used.
 *
 * Each map point may carry a multiplier color. If properly
 * calculated, these can do shading effects on the object, producing
 * 3D effects.
 *
 * As usual, Evas provides both the raw and easy to use methods. The
 * raw methods allow developers to create their maps somewhere else,
 * possibly loading them from some file format. The easy to use methods
 * calculate the points given some high-level parameters such as
 * rotation angle, ambient light, and so on.
 *
 * @note applying mapping will reduce performance, so use with
 *       care. The impact on performance depends on engine in
 *       use. Software is quite optimized, but not as fast as OpenGL.
 *
 * @section sec-map-points Map points
 * @subsection subsec-rotation Rotation
 *
 * A map consists of a set of points, currently only four are supported. Each
 * of these points contains a set of canvas coordinates @c x and @c y that
 * can be used to alter the geometry of the mapped object, and a @c z
 * coordinate that indicates the depth of that point. This last coordinate
 * does not normally affect the map, but it's used by several of the utility
 * functions to calculate the right position of the point given other
 * parameters.
 *
 * The coordinates for each point are set with evas_map_point_coord_set().
 * The following image shows a map set to match the geometry of an existing
 * object.
 *
 * @image html map-set-map-points-1.png
 * @image rtf map-set-map-points-1.png
 * @image latex map-set-map-points-1.eps
 *
 * This is a common practice, so there are a few functions that help make it
 * easier.
 *
 * evas_map_util_points_populate_from_geometry() sets the coordinates of each
 * point in the given map to match the rectangle defined by the function
 * parameters.
 *
 * evas_map_util_points_populate_from_object() and
 * evas_map_util_points_populate_from_object_full() both take an object and
 * set the map points to match its geometry. The difference between the two
 * is that the first function sets the @c z value of all points to 0, while
 * the latter receives the value to set in said coordinate as a parameter.
 *
 * The following lines of code all produce the same result as in the image
 * above.
 * @code
 * evas_map_util_points_populate_from_geometry(m, 100, 100, 200, 200, 0);
 * // Assuming o is our original object
 * evas_object_move(o, 100, 100);
 * evas_object_resize(o, 200, 200);
 * evas_map_util_points_populate_from_object(m, o);
 * evas_map_util_points_populate_from_object_full(m, o, 0);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Several effects can be applied to an object by simply setting each point
 * of the map to the right coordinates. For example, a simulated perspective
 * could be achieve as follows.
 *
 * @image html map-set-map-points-2.png
 * @image rtf map-set-map-points-2.png
 * @image latex map-set-map-points-2.eps
 *
 * As said before, the @c z coordinate is unused here so when setting points
 * by hand, its value is of no importance.
 *
 * @image html map-set-map-points-3.png
 * @image rtf map-set-map-points-3.png
 * @image latex map-set-map-points-3.eps
 *
 * In all three cases above, setting the map to be used by the object is the
 * same.
 * @code
 * evas_object_map_set(o, m);
 * evas_object_map_enable_set(o, EINA_TRUE);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Doing things this way, however, is a lot of work that can be avoided by
 * using the provided utility functions, as described in the next section.
 *
 * @section map-utils Utility functions
 *
 * Utility functions take an already set up map and alter it to produce a
 * specific effect. For example, to rotate an object around its own center
 * you would need to take the rotation angle, the coordinates of each corner
 * of the object and do all the math to get the new set of coordinates that
 * need to be set in the map.
 *
 * Or you can use this code:
 * @code
 * evas_object_geometry_get(o, &x, &y, &w, &h);
 * m = evas_map_new(4);
 * evas_map_util_points_populate_from_object(m, o);
 * evas_map_util_rotate(m, 45, x + (w / 2), y + (h / 2));
 * evas_object_map_set(o, m);
 * evas_object_map_enable_set(o, EINA_TRUE);
 * evas_map_free(m);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Which will rotate the object around its center point in a 45 degree angle
 * in the clockwise direction, taking it from this
 *
 * @image html map-rotation-2d-1.png
 * @image rtf map-rotation-2d-1.png
 * @image latex map-rotation-2d-1.eps
 *
 * to this
 *
 * @image html map-rotation-2d-2.png
 * @image rtf map-rotation-2d-2.png
 * @image latex map-rotation-2d-2.eps
 *
 * Objects may be rotated around any other point just by setting the last two
 * paramaters of the evas_map_util_rotate() function to the right values. A
 * circle of roughly the diameter of the object overlaid on each image shows
 * where the center of rotation is set for each example.
 *
 * For example, this code
 * @code
 * evas_object_geometry_get(o, &x, &y, &w, &h);
 * m = evas_map_new(4);
 * evas_map_util_points_populate_from_object(m, o);
 * evas_map_util_rotate(m, 45, x + w - 20, y + h - 20);
 * evas_object_map_set(o, m);
 * evas_object_map_enable_set(o, EINA_TRUE);
 * evas_map_free(m);
 * @endcode
 *
 * produces something like
 *
 * @image html map-rotation-2d-3.png
 * @image rtf map-rotation-2d-3.png
 * @image latex map-rotation-2d-3.eps
 *
 * And the following
 * @code
 * evas_output_size_get(evas, &w, &h);
 * m = evas_map_new(4);
 * evas_map_util_points_populate_from_object(m, o);
 * evas_map_util_rotate(m, 45, w, h);
 * evas_object_map_set(o, m);
 * evas_object_map_enable_set(o, EINA_TRUE);
 * evas_map_free(m);
 * @endcode
 *
 * rotates the object around the center of the window
 *
 * @image html map-rotation-2d-4.png
 * @image rtf map-rotation-2d-4.png
 * @image latex map-rotation-2d-4.eps
 *
 * @subsection subsec-3d 3D Maps
 *
 * Maps can also be used to achieve the effect of 3-dimensionality. When doing
 * this, the @c z coordinate of each point counts, with higher values meaning
 * the point is further into the screen, and smaller values (negative, usually)
 * meaning the point is closer towards the user.
 *
 * Thinking in 3D also introduces the concept of back-face of an object. An
 * object is said to be facing the user when all its points are placed in a
 * clockwise fashion. The next image shows this, with each point showing the
 * with which is identified within the map.
 *
 * @image html map-point-order-face.png
 * @image rtf map-point-order-face.png
 * @image latex map-point-order-face.eps
 *
 * Rotating this map around the @c Y axis would leave the order of the points
 * in a counter-clockwise fashion, as seen in the following image.
 *
 * @image html map-point-order-back.png
 * @image rtf map-point-order-back.png
 * @image latex map-point-order-back.eps
 *
 * This way we can say that we are looking at the back face of the object.
 * This will have stronger implications later when we talk about lighting.
 *
 * To know if a map is facing towards the user or not it's enough to use
 * the evas_map_util_clockwise_get() function, but this is normally done
 * after all the other operations are applied on the map.
 *
 * @subsection subsec-3d-rot 3D rotation and perspective
 *
 * Much like evas_map_util_rotate(), there's the function
 * evas_map_util_3d_rotate() that transforms the map to apply a 3D rotation
 * to an object. As in its 2D counterpart, the rotation can be applied around
 * any point in the canvas, this time with a @c z coordinate too. The rotation
 * can also be around any of the 3 axis.
 *
 * Starting from this simple setup
 *
 * @image html map-3d-basic-1.png
 * @image rtf map-3d-basic-1.png
 * @image latex map-3d-basic-1.eps
 *
 * and setting maps so that the blue square to rotate on all axis around a
 * sphere that uses the object as its center, and the red square to rotate
 * around the @c Y axis, we get the following. A simple overlay over the image
 * shows the original geometry of each object and the axis around which they
 * are being rotated, with the @c Z one not appearing due to being orthogonal
 * to the screen.
 *
 * @image html map-3d-basic-2.png
 * @image rtf map-3d-basic-2.png
 * @image latex map-3d-basic-2.eps
 *
 * which doesn't look very real. This can be helped by adding perspective
 * to the transformation, which can be simply done by calling
 * evas_map_util_3d_perspective() on the map after its position has been set.
 * The result in this case, making the vanishing point the center of each
 * object:
 *
 * @image html map-3d-basic-3.png
 * @image rtf map-3d-basic-3.png
 * @image latex map-3d-basic-3.eps
 *
 * @section sec-color Color and lighting
 *
 * Each point in a map can be set to a color, which will be multiplied with
 * the objects own color and linearly interpolated in between adjacent points.
 * This is done with evas_map_point_color_set() for each point of the map,
 * or evas_map_util_points_color_set() to set every point to the same color.
 *
 * When using 3D effects, colors can be used to improve the looks of them by
 * simulating a light source. The evas_map_util_3d_lighting() function makes
 * this task easier by taking the coordinates of the light source and its
 * color, along with the color of the ambient light. Evas then sets the color
 * of each point based on the distance to the light source, the angle with
 * which the object is facing the light and the ambient light. Here, the
 * orientation of each point as explained before, becomes more important.
 * If the map is defined counter-clockwise, the object will be facing away
 * from the user and thus become obscured, since no light would be reflecting
 * from it.
 *

 * Images need some special handling when mapped. Evas can easily take care
 * of objects and do almost anything with them, but it's completely oblivious
 * to the content of images, so each point in the map needs to be told to what
 * pixel in the source image it belongs. Failing to do may sometimes result
 * in the expected behavior, or it may look like a partial work.
 *
 * The next image illustrates one possibility of a map being set to an image
 * object, without setting the right UV mapping for each point. The objects
 * themselves are mapped properly to their new geometry, but the image content
 * may not be displayed correctly within the mapped object.

 *
 * Once Evas knows how to handle the source image within the map, it will
 * transform it as needed. This is done with evas_map_point_image_uv_set(),
 * which tells the map to which pixel in image it maps.
 *
 * To match our example images to the maps above all we need is the size of
 * each image, which can always be found with evas_object_image_size_get().

 * evas_map_point_image_uv_set(m, 0, 0, 0);
