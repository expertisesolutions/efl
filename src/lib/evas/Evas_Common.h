/**
 * @defgroup Evas_Object_Rectangle Rectangle Object Functions
 *
 * @brief Function to create evas rectangle objects.
 *
 * There is only one function to deal with rectangle objects, this may make this
 * function seem useless given there are no functions to manipulate the created
 * rectangle, however the rectangle is actually very useful and should be
 * manipulated using the generic @ref Evas_Object_Group "evas object functions".
 *
 * The evas rectangle serves a number of key functions when working on evas
 * programs:
 * @li Background
 * @li Debugging
 * @li Clipper
 *
 * @section Background
 *
 * One extremely common requirement of evas programs is to have a solid color
 * background, this can be accomplished with the following very simple code:
 * @code
 * Evas_Object *bg = evas_object_rectangle_add(evas_canvas);
 * //Here we set the rectangles red, green, blue and opacity levels
 * evas_object_color_set(bg, 255, 255, 255, 255); // opaque white background
 * evas_object_resize(bg, WIDTH, HEIGHT); // covers full canvas
 * evas_object_show(bg);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This will have issues if the @c evas_canvas is resized, however most
 * windows are created using ecore evas and that has a solution to using the
 * rectangle as a background:
 * @code
 * Evas_Object *bg = evas_object_rectangle_add(ecore_evas_get(ee));
 * //Here we set the rectangles red, green, blue and opacity levels
 * evas_object_color_set(bg, 255, 255, 255, 255); // opaque white background
 * evas_object_resize(bg, WIDTH, HEIGHT); // covers full canvas
 * evas_object_show(bg);
 * ecore_evas_object_associate(ee, bg, ECORE_EVAS_OBJECT_ASSOCIATE_BASE);
 * @endcode
 * So this gives us a white background to our window that will be resized
 * together with it.
 *
 * @section Debugging
 *
 * Debugging is a major part of any programmers task and when debugging visual
 * issues with evas programs the rectangle is an extremely useful tool. The
 * rectangle's simplicity means that it's easier to pinpoint issues with it than
 * with more complex objects. Therefore a common technique to use when writing
 * an evas program and not getting the desired visual result is to replace the
 * misbehaving object for a solid color rectangle and seeing how it interacts
 * with the other elements, this often allows us to notice clipping, parenting
 * or positioning issues. Once the issues have been identified and corrected the
 * rectangle can be replaced for the original part and in all likelihood any
 * remaining issues will be specific to that object's type.
 *
 * @section clipping Clipping
 *
 * Clipping serves two main functions:
 * @li Limiting visibility(i.e. hiding portions of an object).
 * @li Applying a layer of color to an object.
 *
 * @subsection hiding Limiting visibility
 *
 * It is often necessary to show only parts of an object, while it may be
 * possible to create an object that corresponds only to the part that must be
 * shown(and it isn't always possible) it's usually easier to use a a clipper. A
 * clipper is a rectangle that defines what's visible and what is not. The way
 * to do this is to create a solid white rectangle(which is the default, no need
 * to call evas_object_color_set()) and give it a position and size of what
 * should be visible. The following code exemplifies showing the center half of
 * @c my_evas_object:
 * @code
 * Evas_Object *clipper = evas_object_rectangle_add(evas_canvas);
 * evas_object_move(clipper, my_evas_object_x / 4, my_evas_object_y / 4);
 * evas_object_resize(clipper, my_evas_object_width / 2, my_evas_object_height / 2);
 * evas_object_clip_set(my_evas_object, clipper);
 * evas_object_show(clipper);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @subsection color Layer of color
 *
 * In the @ref clipping section we used a solid white clipper that produced no
 * change in the color of the clipped object, it just hid what was outside the
 * clippers area. It is however sometimes desirable to change the color of an
 * object, this can be accomplished using a clipper that has a non-white color.
 * Clippers with color work by multiplying the colors of clipped object. The
 * following code will show how to remove all the red from an object:
 * @code
 * Evas_Object *clipper = evas_object_rectangle_add(evas);
 * evas_object_move(clipper, my_evas_object_x, my_evas_object_y);
 * evas_object_resize(clipper, my_evas_object_width, my_evas_object_height);
 * evas_object_color_set(clipper, 0, 255, 255, 255);
 * evas_object_clip_set(obj, clipper);
 * evas_object_show(clipper);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @warning We don't guarantee any proper results if you create a Rectangle
 * object without setting the evas engine.
 *
 * For an example that more fully exercise the use of an evas object rectangle
 * see @ref Example_Evas_Object_Manipulation.

/**
 * @defgroup Evas_Object_Image Image Object Functions
 *
 * Here are grouped together functions used to create and manipulate
 * image objects. They are available to whichever occasion one needs
 * complex imagery on a GUI that could not be achieved by the other
 * Evas' primitive object types, or to make image manipulations.
 *
 * Evas will support whatever image file types it was compiled with
 * support to (its image loaders) -- check your software packager for
 * that information and see
 * evas_object_image_extension_can_load_get().
 *
 * @section Evas_Object_Image_Basics Image object basics
 *
 * The most common use of image objects -- to display an image on the
 * canvas -- is achieved by a common function triplet:
 * @code
 * img = evas_object_image_add(canvas);
 * evas_object_image_file_set(img, "path/to/img", NULL);
 * evas_object_image_fill_set(img, 0, 0, w, h);
 * @endcode
 * The first function, naturally, is creating the image object. Then,
 * one must set a source file on it, so that it knows where to fetch
 * image data from. Next, one must set <b>how to fill the image
 * object's area</b> with that given pixel data. One could use just a
 * sub-region of the original image or even have it tiled repeatedly
 * on the image object. For the common case of having the whole source
 * image to be displayed on the image object, stretched to the
 * destination's size, there's also a function helper, to be used
 * instead of evas_object_image_fill_set():
 * @code
 * evas_object_image_filled_set(img, EINA_TRUE);
 * @endcode
 * See those functions' documentation for more details.
 *
 * @section Evas_Object_Image_Scale Scale and resizing
 *
 * Resizing of image objects will scale their respective source images
 * to their areas, if they are set to "fill" the object's area
 * (evas_object_image_filled_set()). If the user wants any control on
 * the aspect ratio of an image for different sizes, he/she has to
 * take care of that themselves. There are functions to make images to
 * get loaded scaled (up or down) in memory, already, if the user is
 * going to use them at pre-determined sizes and wants to save
 * computations.
 *
 * Evas has even a scale cache that will take care of caching scaled
 * versions of images with more often usage/hits. Finally, one can
 * have images being rescaled @b smoothly by Evas (more
 * computationally expensive) or not.
 *
 * @section Evas_Object_Image_Performance Performance hints
 *
 * When dealing with image objects, there are some tricks to boost the
 * performance of your application, if it does intense image loading
 * and/or manipulations, as in animations on a UI.
 *
 * @subsection Evas_Object_Image_Load Load hints
 *
 * In image viewer applications, for example, the user will be looking
 * at a given image, at full size, and will desire that the navigation
 * to the adjacent images on his/her album be fluid and fast. Thus,
 * while displaying a given image, the program can be in the
 * background loading the next and previous images already, so that
 * displaying them in sequence is just a matter of repainting the
 * screen (and not decoding image data).
 *
 * Evas addresses this issue with <b>image pre-loading</b>. The code
 * for the situation above would be something like the following:
 * @code
 * prev = evas_object_image_filled_add(canvas);
 * evas_object_image_file_set(prev, "/path/to/prev", NULL);
 * evas_object_image_preload(prev, EINA_TRUE);
 *
 * next = evas_object_image_filled_add(canvas);
 * evas_object_image_file_set(next, "/path/to/next", NULL);
 * evas_object_image_preload(next, EINA_TRUE);
 * @endcode
 *
 * If you're loading images that are too big, consider setting
 * previously it's loading size to something smaller, in case you
 * won't expose them in real size. It may speed up the loading
 * considerably:
 * @code
 * //to load a scaled down version of the image in memory, if that's
 * //the size you'll be displaying it anyway
 * evas_object_image_load_scale_down_set(img, zoom);
 *
 * //optional: if you know you'll be showing a sub-set of the image's
 * //pixels, you can avoid loading the complementary data
 * evas_object_image_load_region_set(img, x, y, w, h);
 * @endcode
 * Refer to Elementary's Photocam widget for a high level (smart)
 * object that does lots of loading speed-ups for you.
 *
 * @subsection Evas_Object_Image_Animation Animation hints
 *
 * If you want to animate image objects on a UI (what you'd get by
 * concomitant usage of other libraries, like Ecore and Edje), there
 * are also some tips on how to boost the performance of your
 * application. If the animation involves resizing of an image (thus,
 * re-scaling), you'd better turn off smooth scaling on it @b during
 * the animation, turning it back on afterwards, for less
 * computations. Also, in this case you'd better flag the image object
 * in question not to cache scaled versions of it:
 * @code
 * evas_object_image_scale_hint_set(wd->img, EVAS_IMAGE_SCALE_HINT_DYNAMIC);
 *
 * // resizing takes place in between
 *
 * evas_object_image_scale_hint_set(wd->img, EVAS_IMAGE_SCALE_HINT_STATIC);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Finally, movement of opaque images through the canvas is less
 * expensive than of translucid ones, because of blending
 * computations.
 *
 * @section Evas_Object_Image_Borders Borders
 *
 * Evas provides facilities for one to specify an image's region to be
 * treated specially -- as "borders". This will make those regions be
 * treated specially on resizing scales, by keeping their aspect. This
 * makes setting frames around other objects on UIs easy.
 * See the following figures for a visual explanation:\n
 * @image rtf image-borders.png
 * @image html image-borders.png
 * @image latex image-borders.eps width=\textwidth
 * @image rtf border-effect.png
 * @image html border-effect.png
 * @image latex border-effect.eps width=\textwidth
 *
 * @section Evas_Object_Image_Manipulation Manipulating pixels
 *
 * Evas image objects can be used to manipulate raw pixels in many
 * ways.  The meaning of the data in the pixel arrays will depend on
 * the image's color space, be warned (see next section). You can set
 * your own data as an image's pixel data, fetch an image's pixel data
 * for saving/altering, convert images between different color spaces
 * and even advanced operations like setting a native surface as image
 * objects' data.
 *
 * @section Evas_Object_Image_Color_Spaces Color spaces
 *
 * Image objects may return or accept "image data" in multiple
 * formats. This is based on the color space of an object. Here is a
 * rundown on formats:
 *
 * - #EVAS_COLORSPACE_ARGB8888:
 *   This pixel format is a linear block of pixels, starting at the
 *   top-left row by row until the bottom right of the image or pixel
 *   region. All pixels are 32-bit unsigned int's with the high-byte
 *   being alpha and the low byte being blue in the format ARGB. Alpha
 *   may or may not be used by evas depending on the alpha flag of the
 *   image, but if not used, should be set to 0xff anyway.
 *   \n\n
 *   This colorspace uses premultiplied alpha. That means that R, G
 *   and B cannot exceed A in value. The conversion from
 *   non-premultiplied colorspace is:
 *   \n\n
 *   R = (r * a) / 255; G = (g * a) / 255; B = (b * a) / 255;
 *   \n\n
 *   So 50% transparent blue will be: 0x80000080. This will not be
 *   "dark" - just 50% transparent. Values are 0 == black, 255 ==
 *   solid or full red, green or blue.
 * .
 * - #EVAS_COLORSPACE_YCBCR422P601_PL:
 *   This is a pointer-list indirected set of YUV (YCbCr) pixel
 *   data. This means that the data returned or set is not actual
 *   pixel data, but pointers TO lines of pixel data. The list of
 *   pointers will first be N rows of pointers to the Y plane -
 *   pointing to the first pixel at the start of each row in the Y
 *   plane. N is the height of the image data in pixels. Each pixel in
 *   the Y, U and V planes is 1 byte exactly, packed. The next N / 2
 *   pointers will point to rows in the U plane, and the next N / 2
 *   pointers will point to the V plane rows. U and V planes are half
 *   the horizontal and vertical resolution of the Y plane.
 *   \n\n
 *   Row order is top to bottom and row pixels are stored left to
 *   right.
 *   \n\n
 *   There is a limitation that these images MUST be a multiple of 2
 *   pixels in size horizontally or vertically. This is due to the U
 *   and V planes being half resolution. Also note that this assumes
 *   the itu601 YUV colorspace specification. This is defined for
 *   standard television and mpeg streams. HDTV may use the itu709
 *   specification.
 *   \n\n
 *   Values are 0 to 255, indicating full or no signal in that plane
 *   respectively.
 * .
 * - #EVAS_COLORSPACE_YCBCR422P709_PL:
 *   Not implemented yet.
 * .
 * - #EVAS_COLORSPACE_RGB565_A5P:
 *   In the process of being implemented in 1 engine only. This may
 *   change.
 *   \n\n
 *   This is a pointer to image data for 16-bit half-word pixel data
 *   in 16bpp RGB 565 format (5 bits red, 6 bits green, 5 bits blue),
 *   with the high-byte containing red and the low byte containing
 *   blue, per pixel. This data is packed row by row from the top-left
 *   to the bottom right.
 *   \n\n
 *   If the image has an alpha channel enabled there will be an extra
 *   alpha plane after the color pixel plane. If not, then this data
 *   will not exist and should not be accessed in any way. This plane
 *   is a set of pixels with 1 byte per pixel defining the alpha
 *   values of all pixels in the image from the top-left to the bottom
 *   right of the image, row by row. Even though the values of the
 *   alpha pixels can be 0 to 255, only values 0 through to 32 are
 *   used, 32 being solid and 0 being transparent.
 *   \n\n
 *   RGB values can be 0 to 31 for red and blue and 0 to 63 for green,
 *   with 0 being black and 31 or 63 being full red, green or blue
 *   respectively. This colorspace is also pre-multiplied like
 *   EVAS_COLORSPACE_ARGB8888 so:
 *   \n\n
 *   R = (r * a) / 32; G = (g * a) / 32; B = (b * a) / 32;
 * .
 * - #EVAS_COLORSPACE_GRY8:
 *   The image is just an alpha mask (8 bit's per pixel). This is used
 *   for alpha masking.
 *
 * @warning We don't guarantee any proper results if you create an Image object
 * without setting the evas engine.

 * @defgroup Evas_Keys Key Input Functions
 *
 * Functions that feed key events to the canvas.
 *
 * As explained in @ref intro_not_evas, Evas is @b not aware of input
 * systems at all. Then, the user, if using it crudely (evas_new()),
 * will have to feed it with input events, so that it can react
 * somehow. If, however, the user creates a canvas by means of the
 * Ecore_Evas wrapper, it will automatically bind the chosen display
 * engine's input events to the canvas, for you.
 *
 * This group presents the functions dealing with the feeding of key
 * events to the canvas. On most of them, one has to reference a given
 * key by a name (<code>keyname</code> argument). Those are
 * <b>platform dependent</b> symbolic names for the keys. Sometimes
 * you'll get the right <code>keyname</code> by simply using an ASCII
 * value of the key name, but it won't be like that always.
 *
 * Typical platforms are Linux frame buffer (Ecore_FB) and X server
 * (Ecore_X) when using Evas with Ecore and Ecore_Evas. Please refer
 * to your display engine's documentation when using evas through an
 * Ecore helper wrapper when you need the <code>keyname</code>s.
 *
 * Example:
 * @dontinclude evas-events.c
 * @skip mods = evas_key_modifier_get(evas);
 * @until {
 *
 * All the other @c evas_key functions behave on the same manner. See
 * the full @ref Example_Evas_Events "example".
