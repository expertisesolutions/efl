 * @brief Layout function which sets the box o to a (basic) horizontal box
 *
 * In this layout, the box object's overall behavior is controlled by its
 * padding/alignment properties, which are set by the
 * evas_object_box_{h,v}_{align,padding}_set family of functions. The size
 * hints of the elements in the box -- set by the
 * evas_object_size_hint_{align,padding,weight}_set functions -- also control
 * the way this function works.
 *
 * Box's properties: @c align_h controls the horizontal alignment of the child
 * objects relative to the containing box. When set to $0.0, children are
 * aligned to the left. A value of $1.0 makes them aligned to the right border.
 * Values in between align them proportionally. Note that if the size required
 * by the children, which is given by their widths and the @c padding_h
 * property of the box, is bigger than the their container's width, the
 * children will be displayed out of the box's bounds. A negative value of
 * @c align_h makes the box to justify its children. The padding between them,
 * in this case, is corrected so that the leftmost one touches the left border
 * and the rightmost one touches the right border (even if they must overlap).
 * The @c align_v and @c padding_v properties of the box don't contribute to
 * its behaviour when this layout is chosen.
 *
 * Child element's properties: @c align_x does not influence the box's
 * behavior. @c padding_l and @c padding_r sum up to the container's horizontal
 * padding between elements. The child's @c padding_t, @c padding_b and
 * @c align_y properties apply for padding/alignment relative to the overall
 * height of the box. Finally, there is the @c weight_x property, which, if set
 * to a non-zero value, tells the container that the child width is not
 * pre-defined. If the container can't accommodate all its children, it sets
 * the widths of the ones with weights to sizes as small as they can all fit
 * into it. If the size required by the children is less than the available,
 * the box increases its childrens' (which have weights) widths as to fit the
 * remaining space. The @c weight_x property, besides telling the element is
 * resizable, gives a weight for the resizing process.  The parent box will try
 * to distribute (or take off) widths accordingly to the normalized list of
 * weights: most weighted children remain/get larger in this process than the
 * least ones. @c weight_y does not influence the layout.
 *
 * If one desires that, besides having weights, child elements must be resized
 * bounded to a minimum or maximum size, those size hints must be set, by the
 * evas_object_size_hint_{min,max}_set functions.

 *
 * In a flow horizontal box, the box's child elements are placed in rows (think
 * of text as an analogy). A row has as many elements as can fit into the box's
 * width. The box's overall behavior is controlled by its properties, which are
 * set by the evas_object_box_{h,v}_{align,padding}_set family of functions.
 *  The size hints of the elements in the box -- set by the
 * evas_object_size_hint_{align,padding,weight}_set functions -- also control
 * the way this function works.
 *
 * Box's properties: @c padding_h tells the box to draw empty spaces of that
 * size, in pixels, between the child objects' cells. @c align_h dictates the
 * horizontal alignment of the rows ($0.0 to left align them, $1.0 to right
 * align). A value of $-1.0 to @c align_h lets the rows justified horizontally.
 * @c align_v controls the vertical alignment of the entire set of rows ($0.0
 * to top, $1.0 to bottom). A value of $-1.0 to @c align_v makes the box to
 * justify the rows vertically. The padding between them in this case is
 * corrected so that the first row touches the top border and the last one
 * touches the bottom border (even if they must overlap). @c padding_v has no
 * influence on the layout.
 *
 * Child element's properties: @c padding_l and @c padding_r sum up to the
 * required width of the child element. The @c align_x property has no
 * influence on the layout. The child's @c padding_t and @c padding_b sum up to
 * the required height of the child element and is the only means (besides row
 * justifying) of setting space between rows. Note, however, that @c align_y
 * dictates positioning relative to the largest height required by a child
 * object in the actual row.
