                The caller must ensure to call at least emodel_prop_list before being

               Get children slice OR full range.

               @return: @c Emodel_Load_Status. See below for more info.

               Before being able to get the children list the model status must be
               on loaded status (EMODEL_LOAD_STATUS_LOADED).
               However there may be circunstancies where the model could be
               in a different state, in such cases it is advisable
               to simply return: its current state, which will be
               of course, different than @c EMODEL_LOAD_STATUS_LOADED_CHILDREN.
               When children accessor is return:ed as NULL one should then
               test the current load status return:ed by @children_slice_get
               in order to check against an empty list or real error.

               children_slice_get behaves in two different ways, it may provide
               the slice if both @c start AND @c count are non-zero OR full range otherwise.

               The return:ed Eina_Accessor must be freed when it is no longer needed and
               eo_unref() must be invoked for children if caller wants a copy.

               Since 'slice' is a range, for example if we have 20 childs a slice could be
               the range from 3(start) to 4(count), see:
               child 0  [no]
               child 1  [no]
               child 2  [yes]
               child 3  [yes]
               child 4  [yes]
               child 5  [yes]
               child 6  [no]
               child 7  [no]

               Optionally the user can call children_count_get to know
               the number of children so a valid range can be known in advance.

               Below are examples of both usage types: slices and full ranges.
               @code

               // Returns full list
               eo_do(obj, emodel_children_slice_get(0, 0, &children_accessor));

               // Returns 5 items, counting from item #5
               eo_do(obj, emodel_children_slice_get(5, 5, &children_accessor));

                @return: @c EINA_TRUE, on success, @c EINA_FALSE otherwise

                When emodel_load is completed emodel_coildren_count_get can be use
                to get the number of children. children_count_get can also be used
                before calling children_slice_get so a valid range is known.
