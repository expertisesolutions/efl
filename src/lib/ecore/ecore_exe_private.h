/* FIXME: Getting respawn to work
 *
 * There is no way that we can do anything about the internal state info of
 * an external exe.  The same can be said about the state of user code.  User
 * code in this context means the code that is using ecore_exe to manage exe's
 * for it.
 *
 * Document that the exe must be respawnable, in other words, there is no
 * state that it cannot regenerate by just killing it and starting it again.
 * This includes state that the user code knows about, as the respawn is
 * transparent to that code.  On the other hand, maybe a respawn event might
 * be useful, or maybe resend the currently non existent add event.  For
 * consistancy with ecore_con, an add event is good anyway.
 *
 * The Ecore_exe structure is reused for respawning, so that the (opaque)
 * pointer held by the user remains valid.  This means that the Ecore_Exe
 * init and del functions may need to be split into two parts each to avoid
 * duplicating code - common code part, and the rest.  This implies that
 * the unchanging members mentioned next should NEVER change.
 *
 * These structure members don't need to change -
 *   __list_data       - we stay on the list
 *   data              - passed in originally
 *   cmd               - passed in originally
 *   flags             - passed in originally
 *
 * These structure members need to change -
 *   tag               - state that must be regenerated, zap it
 *   pid               - it will be different
 *   child_fd_write    - it will be different
 *   child_fd_read     - it will be different
 *   child_fd_error    - it will be different
 *   write_fd_handler  - we cannot change the fd used by a handler, this changes coz the fd changes.
 *   read_fd_handler   - we cannot change the fd used by a handler, this changes coz the fd changes.
 *   error_fd_handler  - we cannot change the fd used by a handler, this changes coz the fd changes.
 *
 * Hmm, the read, write, and error buffers could be tricky.
 * They are not atomic, and could be in a semi complete state.
 * They fall into the "state must be regenerated" mentioned above.
 * A respawn/add event should take care of it.
 *
 * These structure members need to change -
 *   write_data_buf    - state that must be regenerated, zap it
 *   write_data_size   - state that must be regenerated, zap it
 *   write_data_offset - state that must be regenerated, zap it
 *   read_data_buf     - state that must be regenerated, zap it
 *   read_data_size    - state that must be regenerated, zap it
 *   error_data_buf    - state that must be regenerated, zap it
 *   error_data_size   - state that must be regenerated, zap it
 *   close_write       - state that must be regenerated, zap it
 *
 * There is the problem that an exe that fell over and needs respawning
 * might keep falling over, keep needing to be respawned, and tie up system
 * resources with the constant respawning.  An exponentially increasing
 * timeout (with maximum timeout) between respawns should take care of that.
 * Although this is not a "contention for a resource" problem, the exe falling
 * over may be, so a random element added to the timeout may help, and won't
 * hurt.  The user code may need to be informed that a timeout is in progress.
