/**
 * @ingroup Ecore_Main_Loop_Group
 * @defgroup Ecore_Event_Group Ecore Event functions
 *
 * Ecore events provide two main features that are of use to those using ecore:
 * creating events and being notified of events. Those two will usually be used
 * in different contexts, creating events is mainly done by libraries wrapping
 * some system functionality while being notified of events is mainly a
 * necessity of applications.
 *
 * For a program to be notified of events it's interested in it needs to have a
 * function to process the event and to register that function as the callback
 * to the event, that's all:
 * @code
 * ecore_event_handler_add(EVENT_TYPE, _my_event_handler, some_data);
 * ...
 * static Eina_Bool
 * _my_event_handler(void *data, int type, void *event)
 * {
 *    //data is some_data
 *    //event is provided by whoever created the event
 *    //Do really cool stuff with event
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * One very important thing to note here is the @c EVENT_TYPE, to register a
 * handler for an event you must know its type before hand. Ecore provides
 * the following events which are emitted in response to POSIX
 * signals(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_%28computing%29):
 * @li @b ECORE_EVENT_SIGNAL_USER
 * @li @b ECORE_EVENT_SIGNAL_HUP
 * @li @b ECORE_EVENT_SIGNAL_POWER
 * @li @b ECORE_EVENT_SIGNAL_EXIT
 *
 * @warning Don't override these using the @c signal or @c sigaction calls.
 * These, however, aren't the only signals one can handle. Many
 * libraries(including ecore modules) have their own signals that can be
 * listened for and handled, to do that one only needs to know the type of the
 * event. This information can be found on the documentation of the library
 * emitting the signal, so, for example, for events related to windowing one
 * would look in @ref Ecore_Evas_Group.
 *
 * Examples of libraries that integrate into ecore's main loop by providing
 * events are @ref Ecore_Con_Group, @ref Ecore_Evas_Group and @ref
 * Ecore_Exe_Group, amongst others. This usage can be divided into two parts,
 * setup and adding events. The setup is very simple, all that needs doing is
 * getting a type id for the event:
 * @code
 * int MY_EV_TYPE = ecore_event_type_new();
 * @endcode
 * @note This variable should be declared in the header since it'll be needed by
 * anyone wishing to register a handler to your event.
 *
 * The complexity of adding of an event to the queue depends on whether that
 * event sends uses @c event, if it doesn't it a one-liner:
 * @code
 * ecore_event_add(MY_EV_TYPE, NULL, NULL, NULL);
 * @endcode
 * The usage when an @c event is needed is not that much more complex and can be
 * seen in @ref ecore_event_add.
 *
 * Examples that deals with events:
 * @li @ref ecore_event_example_01_c
 * @li @ref ecore_event_example_02_c

/**
 * @ingroup Ecore_Main_Loop_Group
 * @defgroup Ecore_Thread_Group Ecore Thread functions
 *
 * Facilities to run heavy tasks in different threads to avoid blocking
 * the main loop.
 *
 * The EFL is, for the most part, not thread safe. This means that if you
 * have some task running in another thread and you have, for example, an
 * Evas object to show the status progress of this task, you cannot update
 * the object from within the thread. This can only be done from the main
 * thread, the one running the main loop. This problem can be solved
 * by running a thread that sends messages to the main one using an
 * @ref Ecore_Pipe_Group "Ecore_Pipe", but when you need to handle other
 * things like cancelling the thread, your code grows in complexity and gets
 * much harder to maintain.
 *
 * Ecore Thread is here to solve that problem. It is @b not a simple wrapper
 * around standard POSIX threads (or the equivalent in other systems) and
 * it's not meant to be used to run parallel tasks throughout the entire
 * duration of the program, especially when these tasks are performance
 * critical, as Ecore manages these tasks using a pool of threads based on
 * system configuration.
 *
 * What Ecore Thread does, is make it a lot easier to dispatch a worker
 * function to perform some heavy task and then get the result once it
 * completes, without blocking the application's UI. In addition, cancelling
 * and rescheduling comes practically for free and the developer needs not
 * worry about how many threads are launched, since Ecore will schedule
 * them according to the number of processors the system has and maximum
 * amount of concurrent threads set for the application.
 *
 * At the system level, Ecore will start a new thread on an as-needed basis
 * until the maximum set is reached. When no more threads can be launched,
 * new worker functions will be queued in a waiting list until a thread
 * becomes available. This way, system threads will be shared throughout
 * different worker functions, but running only one at a time. At the same
 * time, a worker function that is rescheduled may be run on a different
 * thread the next time.
 *
 * The ::Ecore_Thread handler has two meanings, depending on what context
 * it is on. The one returned when starting a worker with any of the
 * functions ecore_thread_run() or ecore_thread_feedback_run() is an
 * identifier of that specific instance of the function and can be used from
 * the main loop with the ecore_thread_cancel() and ecore_thread_check()
 * functions. This handler must not be shared with the worker function
 * function running in the thread. This same handler will be the one received
 * on the @c end, @c cancel and @c feedback callbacks.
 *
 * The worker function, that's the one running in the thread, also receives
 * an ::Ecore_Thread handler that can be used with ecore_thread_cancel() and
 *ecore_thread_check(), sharing the flag with the main loop. But this
 * handler is also associated with the thread where the function is running.
 * This has strong implications when working with thread local data.
 *
 * There are two kinds of worker threads Ecore handles: simple, or short,
 * workers and feedback workers.
 *
 * The first kind is for simple functions that perform a
 * usually small but time consuming task. Ecore will run this function in
 * a thread as soon as one becomes available and notify the calling user of
 * its completion once the task is done.
 *
 * The following image shows the flow of a program running four tasks on
 * a pool of two threads.
 *
 * @image html ecore_thread.png
 * @image rtf ecore_thread.png
 * @image latex ecore_thread.eps width=\\textwidth
 *
 * For larger tasks that may require continuous communication with the main
 * program, the feedback workers provide the same functionality plus a way
 * for the function running in the thread to send messages to the main
 * thread.
 *
 * The next diagram omits some details shown in the previous one regarding
 * how threads are spawned and tasks are queued, but illustrates how feedback
 * jobs communicate with the main loop and the special case of threads
 * running out of pool.

/**
 * Adds some data to a hash local to the thread.

 * @param value The data to add
 * @param cb Function to free the data when removed from the hash
 * @param direct If @c true, this will not copy the key string (like
 * eina_hash_direct_add())
 * @return @c EINA_TRUE on success, @c EINA_FALSE on failure.
 *
 * Ecore Thread has a mechanism to share data across several worker functions
 * that run on the same system thread. That is, the data is stored per
 * thread and for a worker function to have access to it, it must be run
 * by the same thread that stored the data.
 *
 * When there are no more workers pending, the thread will be destroyed
 * along with the internal hash and any data left in it will be freed with
 * the @p cb function given.
 *
 * This set of functions is useful to share things around several instances
 * of a function when that thing is costly to create and can be reused, but
 * may only be used by one function at a time.
 *
 * For example, if you have a program doing requisitions to a database,
 * these requisitions can be done in threads so that waiting for the
 * database to respond doesn't block the UI. Each of these threads will
 * run a function, and each function will be dependent on a connection to
 * the database, which may not be able to handle more than one request at
 * a time so for each running function you will need one connection handle.
 * The options then are:
 * @li Each function opens a connection when it's called, does the work and
 * closes the connection when it finishes. This may be costly, wasting a lot
 * of time on resolving hostnames, negotiating permissions and allocating
 * memory.
 * @li Open the connections in the main loop and pass it to the threads
 * using the data pointer. Even worse, it's just as costly as before and now
 * it may even be kept with connections open doing nothing until a thread
 * becomes available to run the function.
 * @li Have a way to share connection handles, so that each instance of the
 * function can check if an available connection exists, and if it doesn't,
 * create one and add it to the pool. When no more connections are needed,
 * they are all closed.
 *
 * The last option is the most efficient, but it requires a lot of work to
 * implement properly. Using thread local data helps to achieve the same
 * result while avoiding doing all the tracking work on your code. The way
 * to use it would be, at the worker function, to ask for the connection
 * with ecore_thread_local_data_find() and if it doesn't exist, then open
 * a new one and save it with ecore_thread_local_data_add(). Do the work and
 * forget about the connection handle, when everything is done the function
 * just ends. The next worker to run on that thread will check if a
 * connection exists and find that it does, so the process of opening a
 * new one has been spared. When no more workers exist, the thread is
 * destroyed and the callback used when saving the connection will be called
 * to close it.
 *
 * This function adds the data @p value to the thread data under the given
 * @p key.
 * No other value in the hash may have the same @p key. If you need to
 * change the value under a @p key, or you don't know if one exists already,
 * you can use ecore_thread_local_data_set().
 *
 * Neither @p key nor @p value may be @c NULL and @p key will be copied in the
 * hash, unless @p direct is set, in which case the string used should not
 * be freed until the data is removed from the hash.
 *
 * The @p cb function will be called when the data in the hash needs to be
 * freed, be it because it got deleted with ecore_thread_local_data_del() or
 * because @p thread was terminated and the hash destroyed. This parameter
 * may be NULL, in which case @p value needs to be manually freed after
 * removing it from the hash with either ecore_thread_local_data_del() or
 * ecore_thread_local_data_set(), but it's very unlikely that this is what
 * you want.
 *
 * This function, and all of the others in the @c ecore_thread_local_data
 * family of functions, can only be called within the worker function running
 * in the thread. Do not call them from the main loop or from a thread

 *
 * Ecore poller provides infrastructure for the creation of pollers. Pollers
 * are, in essence, callbacks that share a single timer per type. Because not
 * all pollers need to be called at the same frequency the user may specify the
 * frequency in ticks(each expiration of the shared timer is called a tick, in
 * ecore poller parlance) for each added poller. Ecore pollers should only be
 * used when the poller doesn't have specific requirements on the exact times
 * to poll.
 *
 * This architecture means that the main loop is only woken up once to handle
 * all pollers of that type, this will save power as the CPU has more of a
 * chance to go into a low power state the longer it is asleep for, so this
 * should be used in situations where power usage is a concern.
 *
 * For now only 1 core poller type is supported: ECORE_POLLER_CORE, the default
 * interval for ECORE_POLLER_CORE is 0.125(or 1/8th) second.
 *
 * The creation of a poller is extremely simple and only requires one line:
 * @code
 * ecore_poller_add(ECORE_POLLER_CORE, 1, my_poller_function, NULL);
 * @endcode
 * This sample creates a poller to call @c my_poller_function at every tick with
 * @c NULL as data.

 * @brief Ecore animators are a helper to simplify creating

 *
 * Creating an animation is as simple as saying for how long it
 * should be run and having a callback that does the animation,
 * something like this:
 * @code
 * static Eina_Bool
 * _do_animation(void *data, double pos)
 * {
 *    evas_object_move(data, 100 * pos, 100 * pos);
 *    ... do some more animating ...
 * }
 * ...
 * ecore_animator_timeline_add(2, _do_animation, my_evas_object);
 * @endcode
 * In the sample above we create an animation to move
 * @c my_evas_object from position (0,0) to (100,100) in 2 seconds.
 *
 * If your animation will run for an unspecified amount of time you
 * can use ecore_animator_add(), which is like using
 * ecore_timer_add() with the interval being the
 * @ref ecore_animator_frametime_set "framerate". Note that this has
 * tangible benefits to creating a timer for each animation in terms
 * of performance.

 * program isn't handling @ref Ecore_Event_Group "events", @ref Ecore_Timer_Group
 * "timers" or @ref Ecore_FD_Handler_Group "fd handlers".
 *
 * There are three types of idlers: Enterers, Idlers(proper) and Exiters. They

 * when the program is in an idle state and when the program has just left an
 * idle state and will begin processing @ref Ecore_Event_Group "events", @ref
 * Ecore_Timer_Group "timers" or @ref Ecore_FD_Handler_Group "fd handlers".
 *
 * Enterer callbacks are good for updating your program's state, if
 * it has a state engine.  Once all of the enterer handlers are
 * called, the program will enter a "sleeping" state.
 *
 * Idler callbacks are called when the main loop has called all
 * enterer handlers.  They are useful for interfaces that require
 * polling and timers would be too slow to use.
 *
 * Exiter callbacks are called when the main loop wakes up from an idle state.
 *
 * If no idler callbacks are specified, then the process literally
 * goes to sleep.  Otherwise, the idler callbacks are called
 * continuously while the loop is "idle", using as much CPU as is
 * available to the process.
 *
 * @note Idle state doesn't mean that the @b program is idle, but
 * that the <b>main loop</b> is idle. It doesn't have any timers,
 * events, fd handlers or anything else to process (which in most
 * <em>event driven</em> programs also means that the @b program is
