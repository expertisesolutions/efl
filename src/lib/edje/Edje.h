@section edje_main_intro Introduction

Edje is a complex graphical design & layout library.

It doesn't intend to do containing and regular layout like a widget
set, but it is the base for such components. Based on the requirements
of Enlightenment 0.17, Edje should serve all the purposes of creating
visual elements (borders of windows, buttons, scrollbars, etc.) and
allow the designer the ability to animate, layout and control the look
and feel of any program using Edje as its basic GUI constructor. This
library allows for multiple collections of Layouts in one file,
sharing the same image and font database and thus allowing a whole
theme to be conveniently packaged into 1 file and shipped around.

Edje separates the layout and behavior logic. Edje files ship with an
image and font database, used by all the parts in all the collections
to source graphical data. It has a directory of logical part names
pointing to the part collection entry ID in the file (thus allowing
for multiple logical names to point to the same part collection,
allowing for the sharing of data between display elements). Each part
collection consists of a list of visual parts, as well as a list of
programs. A program is a conditionally run program that if a
particular event occurs (a button is pressed, a mouse enters or leaves
a part) will trigger an action that may affect other parts. In this
way a part collection can be "programmed" via its file as to hilight
buttons when the mouse passes over them or show hidden parts when a
button is clicked somewhere etc. The actions performed in changing
from one state to another are also allowed to transition over a period
of time, allowing animation. Programs and animations can be run in
"parallel".

This separation and simplistic event driven style of programming can produce
almost any look and feel one could want for basic visual elements. Anything
more complex is likely the domain of an application or widget set that may
use Edje as a convenient way of being able to configure parts of the display.

For details of Edje's history, see the @ref edje_history section.

@subsection edje_main_work So how does this all work?

Edje internally holds a geometry state machine and state graph of what is
visible, not, where, at what size, with what colors etc. This is described
to Edje from an Edje .edj file containing this information. These files can
be produced by using edje_cc to take a text file (a .edc file) and "compile"
an output .edj file that contains this information, images and any other
data needed.

The application using Edje will then create an object in its Evas
canvas and set the bundle file to use, specifying the @b group name to
use. Edje will load such information and create all the required
children objects with the specified properties as defined in each @b
part of the given group. See the example at @ref edje_main_intro_example.

Although simple, this example illustrates that animations and state
changes can be done from the Edje file itself without any requirement
in the C application.

Before digging into changing or creating your own Edje source (edc)
files, read the @ref edcref.

@subsection edje_history Edje History

It's a sequel to "Ebits" which has serviced the needs of Enlightenment
development for early version 0.17. The original design parameters under
which Ebits came about were a lot more restricted than the resulting
use of them, thus Edje was born.

Edje is a more complex layout engine compared to Ebits. It doesn't
pretend to do containing and regular layout like a widget set. It
still inherits the more simplistic layout ideas behind Ebits, but it
now does them a lot more cleanly, allowing for easy expansion, and the
ability to cover much more ground than Ebits ever could. For the
purposes of Enlightenment 0.17, Edje was conceived to serve all the
purposes of creating visual elements (borders of windows, buttons,
scrollbars, etc.) and allow the designer the ability to animate,
layout and control the look and feel of any program using Edje as its
basic GUI constructor.

Unlike Ebits, Edje separates the layout and behavior logic.

@section edje_main_compiling How to compile

Edje is a library your application links to. The procedure for this is
very simple. You simply have to compile your application with the
appropriate compiler flags that the @c pkg-config script outputs. For
example:

Compiling C or C++ files into object files:

@verbatim
gcc -c -o main.o main.c `pkg-config --cflags edje`
@endverbatim

Linking object files into a binary executable:

@verbatim
gcc -o my_application main.o `pkg-config --libs edje`
@endverbatim

See @ref pkgconfig

@section edje_main_next_steps Next Steps

After you understood what Edje is and installed it in your system you
should proceed understanding the programming interface for all
objects, then see the specific for the most used elements. We'd
recommend you to take a while to learn @ref Ecore, @ref Evas, @ref Eo
and @ref Eina as they are the building blocks for Edje. There is a
widget set built on top of Edje providing high level elements such as
buttons, lists and selectors called Elementary
(http://docs.enlightenment.org/auto/elementary/) as they will likely
save you tons of work compared to using just Evas directly.

@section edje_main_intro_example Introductory Example

What follows is a list with various commented examples, covering a great
part of Edje's API:

@include edje_example.c

The above example requires the following annotated source Edje file:
@include edje_example.edc
